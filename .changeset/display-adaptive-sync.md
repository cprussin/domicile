A display profile can turn on adaptive sync (variable refresh rate, FreeSync, G-Sync Compatible) per monitor with `adaptive_sync: true`. It is off by default, asked for only where the monitor and driver report support, and retried without it when the driver refuses the modeset. The SDK's `Display` gains `adaptiveSync` (`unsupported`, `off` or `on`), which says what the hardware is doing. Settings now reads profiles that set `refresh` or `adaptive_sync` instead of refusing them.
