The app chooser asks in plain words. With one application it asks "Open Claude?" beside Claude's icon ("Chromium wants to open this link in Claude."); with several, "Choose an app to open this link"; with none, "No app can open this link" and only Close. The link shows on one muted line at the bottom. `AppChooser` takes `asker`, `opened` and `address` in place of `title` and `description`.
