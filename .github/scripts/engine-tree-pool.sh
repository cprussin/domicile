# Moving `CHROMIUM_PIN` forces a rebuild of about four hours, in both

# tree at their pin, and a run on a pin some tree already carries skips the
# reset, apply and compile. See
# packages/domicile-engine/docs/BUILD-MACHINE.md#tree-pool.
#
# - Each tree is built at its own path (`/build/trees/tree-N`) so two runs can
#   build at once. `gn gen` writes absolute paths, so a tree must keep its path.
#   `/build/chromium` is a symlink for people; CI does not read it.
# - This script only picks a directory. `engine-series-stamp.sh` checks what
#   the tree holds. Stamps are read here only to rank trees and to guess
#   whether a run compiles.
# - The slots belong to the machine: `setup-chromium-trees.service`
#   (cprussin/dotfiles: config/machines/crux/chromium-build.nix) creates them.
#   This script never creates one, since each costs about 97G of disk.
