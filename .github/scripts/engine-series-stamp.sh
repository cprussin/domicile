#   .github/scripts/engine-series-stamp.sh carries  <chromium/src>
#   .github/scripts/engine-series-stamp.sh record   <chromium/src>
#   .github/scripts/engine-series-stamp.sh identity
#
# - `carries` writes `carries=true|false` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT and exits 0. Any
#   doubt answers `false`, which costs only a normal reset and apply.
# - `record` writes the stamp after `apply.sh`.
# - `identity` prints the series hash. `engine-release-publish.sh` tags releases
#   with it.
#
# Resetting and reapplying gives every patched file a new mtime, which forces a
# long rebuild even when nothing changed. That is the cost this avoids.
#
# A false `true` would report a build of other code as the pull request's, so
# the stamp is not trusted alone. `carries` also checks:
#
#   - the series identity (pin, patches and laid-down files, by content);
#   - HEAD matches the stamped commit, since other workflows and people reset
#     this tree;
#   - the only changes in the checkout are the series' untracked files;
#   - each of those files matches the repository's byte for byte. `git status`
#     cannot see changes to untracked files.
#
# The stamp lives outside `src/` for the reason given in engine-sync.sh.
