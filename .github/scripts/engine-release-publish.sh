A patched Chromium, built on crux, that \`domicile-compositor\` can use as its
engine without anybody building one.

- series identity: \`$IDENTITY\`
- domicile commit: \`$GITHUB_SHA\`
- chromium pin: \`$PIN\`
- build: \`${DOMICILE_ENGINE_BUILD:-checked}\`
- gn args: \`.github/scripts/engine-release-build.sh\` at that commit${PINNABLE:+
- immutable release: \`$PINNABLE\`}

Unpack it and put the directory on \`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\`:
\`libdomicile_engine.so\` is dlopened by name.

This artifact was asserted before publication by the same pixel guard the
engine workflow runs: a real Wayland client's window drawn on a page, and a
negative control that fails when nothing draws.
