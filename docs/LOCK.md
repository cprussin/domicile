# The screen lock

The desktop locks after `idle.lock_after_seconds` without input
([IDLE.md](IDLE.md#two-clocks)), before the machine sleeps, when logind locks
the session ([Sleep and logind](#sleep-and-logind)) or when the shell calls
`lock()`, and the user's password unlocks it. While locked, nothing the
chrome forwards reaches a client, and nothing it asks of the desktop is done.
What a shell does with this:
[SHELL-IDLE-AND-LOCK.md](SHELL-IDLE-AND-LOCK.md#locking).

## Where the lock is enforced

The compositor enforces the lock because it is the only process that outlives
the page.

- A lock in the page would fall to a reload, an engine restart or devtools.
- A lock at the chrome socket would block the shell's own keys, so nobody could
  type a passphrase.
- The page keeps all its keys while locked so it can draw the lock screen.

The compositor checks each request in `handle_client_request`, and each
connection request in `answer_on_the_connection`, against
`crate::lock::refused`. That `match` is the source of truth. It has no
wildcard, so a new request does not compile until someone decides how a locked
desktop treats it.

| Category | Examples | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Input | `Key`, pointer motion, buttons, axis, leave; the same from EIS clients (`crate::eis`) | Dropped (`debug` log) |
| Commands | `CloseApp`, `Spawn`, `CopyClipboardEntry`, tray, notifications | Refused (`warn` log) |
| Reads on the connection | `SearchFiles` | Answered with nothing (`warn` log) |
| System calls | `SystemRequest`, except reads under `/sys`, lock screen readouts, listening for shell commands, unlock refusals or window requests, setting window states, and calls that stop something running | A call that starts something is answered `locked`; `stdin` is dropped (`warn` log) |
| Allowed | `ChromeHello`, `Lock`, `Unlock`, `KeyboardFocus`, output scale and size, window bounds and states, `ClipboardCopied`, theme | Handled normally |

Why some requests are allowed:

- `ChromeHello`: a reloaded page learns the desktop is locked from the answer.
- `SetOutputScale`, `SetOutputSize`, `SetAppBounds`, `set_window_states`:
  nothing replays them after unlock.
- `KeyboardFocus`: refusing it would leave the shell and the compositor disagreeing
  about focus after unlock. No key reaches the window while locked anyway.
- `ClipboardCopied`: it is a client's copy, and the history must match pastes.
- `SetTheme`: it opens and reads nothing.
- System reads under `/sys`: the user can change nothing there. Only an
  absolute path with no `..` counts.
- Lock screen readouts: the calls `system-battery`, `system-backlight`,
  `system-audio` and `system-bluetooth` make, so a lock screen shows the
  battery and Bluetooth and sets the brightness and volume. See
  [Lock screen readouts](#lock-screen-readouts).
- `unwatch`, `close_stdin`, `kill`: they stop what the shell started.
- `shell_commands`, `window_requests`: they only listen. A page reloaded
  while locked still hears them after unlock. `send_shell` itself is refused.
- `unlock_refusals`: it only listens, and a lock screen needs it while locked.

## Lock screen readouts

Each call reads state or changes what a laptop's brightness and volume keys
change, so someone at a locked desktop learns or does nothing more.
`domicile_host::lock_screen_readouts` lists each one field by field; `reach`
judges a request `Reach::Readout` only on a full match.
`packages/domicile-protocol/wire/lock-screen-readouts.jsonl` records what each
library sends; the libraries' tests and the allowlist's both check it.

| Library | Call |
|---|---|
| `system-battery` | UPower `DisplayDevice` `GetAll` of `org.freedesktop.UPower.Device`; a match on its `PropertiesChanged` with every field set |
| `system-backlight` | `udevadm monitor --kernel --subsystem-match=backlight`; logind `Session.SetBrightness("backlight", device, level)` on `session/auto` |
| `system-audio` | `pactl -f json info`, `list` and `subscribe`; `pactl -- set-sink-volume NAME N` and `set-sink-mute NAME 0\|1` |
| `system-bluetooth` | BlueZ `GetManagedObjects` on `/`: adapters' power, connected devices and their batteries; a match on every BlueZ signal |

- D-Bus calls are on the system bus only.
- A spawn has no `cwd` or `stdin`, and exactly the library's `env`: none for
  `udevadm`, `LC_ALL=C` for `pactl`.
- `argv[0]` is looked up on the compositor's `PATH`, like every spawn. The lock
  trusts whatever `udevadm` and `pactl` that `PATH` finds.
- Left out: inputs (unmuting a microphone would let a locked desktop record),
  `parec` meters, and every other `pactl` command.
- Left out of BlueZ: power, scanning, pairing and connecting. Someone at a
  locked desktop must not pair a device.

## Ordering

- **Input counts as activity before it is refused.** `keep_the_desktop_awake`
  runs first, so a key at a locked desktop lights the screens.
- **The lock state changes before the shell is told.** `Lock` updates the state
  that `Seen` reads, under its mutex, before queuing `locked`. A search sent
  after `locked: true` is refused. One sent after `unlock` but before the
  verdict is also refused.
- **The shell is told before the modeset**, so the lock screen is up before the
  screens light.
- **The compositor releases held keys when the desktop locks** (`release_pressed_keys`).
  The refusal would drop the release and leave the key stuck down.

## Sleep and logind

`crate::logind` listens to logind on the system bus.

- **Sleep:** the compositor holds a `delay` inhibitor on `sleep`. On
  `PrepareForSleep(true)` it locks, waits 1 second for the shell to draw its
  lock screen, then closes the inhibitor and the machine sleeps. On waking it
  takes a new one. Closing the lid sleeps the same way.
- **`loginctl lock-session`:** logind sends the session's `Lock` signal, and
  the compositor locks. `loginctl unlock-session` does nothing; only the
  passphrase unlocks.
- **No logind**, or a compositor in no session: the log says so and the
  desktop runs as usual, without that lock.

## Verifiers

`crate::lock::Verifier` checks a passphrase. On a desk it is `crate::pam`:
`pam_authenticate` for the compositor's uid, through `lock.pam_service`, or
`domicile` when unset.

The machine declares the service; a home-manager module cannot:

- **NixOS:** `nixosModules.default`, or `security.pam.services.domicile = {};`.
- **Distribution packages** install `/etc/pam.d/domicile` (`distro/pam/`).
- **Anywhere else**, add `/etc/pam.d/domicile`: copy the file for your
  distribution from `distro/pam/`. Each includes the distribution's password
  stack.

Without the file the desktop still locks, and nothing unlocks it. See
[Failures fail closed](#failures-fail-closed).

Tests inject their own verifier: unit tests pass one to `Lock::held_by`, and
`tests/running` starts the compositor with `--pam-confdir` pointing at a
`pam_exec` service of its own.

## Reloading

A reload that changes `lock.pam_service` swaps the verifier
(`Lock::rekeyed`). It never unlocks the desktop.

- **The new service** checks the next passphrase. A check already running
  against the old one cannot unlock: its `Ok(true)` is refused, but not
  counted as a wrong passphrase.
- **The wait** after refused passphrases is kept
  ([Refusals and the wait](#refusals-and-the-wait)).
- **A machine without libpam** refuses the reload and logs it. The current lock
  stays.

## Checking a passphrase

- `pam_unix` sleeps on a wrong password, so the check runs on its own thread.
  `Lock::offered` starts it; the verdict returns over a calloop channel to
  `heard_the_verdict`, which calls `Lock::answered`.
- The desktop stays locked during the check. A second `unlock` during a check is
  dropped.
- A passphrase containing NUL is refused before PAM sees it. C would read only
  the part before the NUL.
- `domicile_protocol::Passphrase` does not print itself, so no log line holds
  what was typed. Linux-PAM overwrites its copy before freeing it.
- A refusal sends `SystemEvent::UnlockRefused` to every page listening with
  `unlock_refusals`, then `locked: true` to every chrome again.

## Refusals and the wait

`crate::unlock_backoff` counts refused passphrases and makes the compositor
wait before checking the next. The shell cannot skip the wait: it never sees
the verifier.

- The first 2 refused passphrases cost nothing. The 3rd starts a 5 second
  wait, and each one after doubles it, up to 5 minutes.
- A passphrase offered during the wait is refused `too_soon`, unchecked.
- `unverifiable` counts too: some PAM stacks fail a wrong passphrase with
  something other than `PAM_AUTH_ERR`.
- Unlocking resets the count.
- The count and wait are kept in memory only. Restarting the compositor resets
  them.

| `refusal` | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `wrong_passphrase` | The verifier checked it, and it is wrong |
| `unverifiable` | The verifier could not check it (see [Failures fail closed](#failures-fail-closed)) |
| `too_soon` | Offered during the wait |

Each refusal carries `failures`, the refused passphrases since the last unlock,
and `retry_in_ms`, the wait left.

## Failures fail closed

Only `PAM_AUTH_ERR` means a wrong passphrase. Any other PAM failure is
`Unlocking::Unverifiable`: the desktop stays locked and the log names the error.

| When | Missing | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Startup or reload | `/etc/pam.d/<service>` | An error names the file and what to declare. The desktop starts and locks as usual |
| Each attempt | `/etc/pam.d/<service>` | `Unverifiable`, naming the file. Adding the file fixes the next attempt, without a restart. Linux-PAM would otherwise fall back to its `other` service |
| Startup | `libpam.so.0` or its `pam_start_confdir` | The compositor exits, naming the library |
| Startup | a user for the uid | The compositor exits |

A desktop without libpam or a user cannot lock, so it does not start.

`pam_start_confdir` gets `/etc/pam.d` explicitly, so the checked directory and
the read directory match.
