# Gestures

Touchpad gestures and touchscreen fingers reach the window under them, and
the shell binds multi-finger gestures and swipes in from a screen's edge the
way it binds keys. Tracks
[#1908](https://github.com/cprussin/domicile/issues/1908).

## Design

```
libinput (engine, tty)  ─┐
host zwp_pointer_gestures ┴▶ engine ──▶ shell page ──▶ <app> ──▶ compositor ──▶ client
(engine, nested)             (ui::GestureEvent       (default    (pointer_pinch,  (zwp_pointer_
                              + NativePinch)          handling)   pointer_axis)    gestures_v1)
                                     │
                                     └─▶ DomicileHost `gesture` ──▶ bindKeys
                                         (3+ fingers, grabbed)
```

| Piece | Where | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Acquisition | engine `libinput_event_converter.cc`, `wayland_zwp_pointer_gestures.cc` (patch `0184`) | Turns libinput or host pinch into a `ui::GestureEvent` carrying `NativePinch`: phase, device, time, fingers, absolute scale, rotation, cancellation |
| Page | engine `touchpad_pinch_event_queue.cc`, `mouse_wheel_event_manager.cc` | Keeps native pinches out of coalescing and page zoom. A canceled `wheel` claims the gesture for the shell |
| `<app>` | `html_app_element.cc` | Forwards the pinch to its client as `pointer_pinch` |
| Wire | `domicile_protocol::pinch::Pinch` | `begin`, `update`, `end` |
| Delivery | `domicile-compositor` (`pinch.rs`) | One active pinch, owned by the connection and device that began it. Ends canceled on pointer leave, lock, window close or a dropped connection |
| Shell grab | engine `native_gesture_sink.*` (patch `0185`), `desk_gestures.*`, `DomicileHost.grabGesture` | libinput (or the host, nested) offers each gesture of three fingers or more to the sink before the pinch path. `DeskGestures` takes it when a page grabbed its kind and count, and sends every phase to the first such page as a `gesture` event. A swipe or hold nobody grabbed goes nowhere; a pinch goes on to the page |
| Bindings | `@domicile-desktop/sdk/gesture-binding`, `bind-keys` | Parses sway's grammar, grabs each kind and count, follows the phases, and runs the binding the finished gesture fits in the current mode |

### Touchscreen

```
evdev (engine, tty)    ─┐
host wl_touch (nested) ─┴▶ engine ──▶ shell page ──▶ <app> ──▶ compositor ──▶ client
                                     (pointer events,  (default    (`touch`)     (wl_touch, or
                                      touch-action:     handling)                 the pointer)
                                      none on <app>)
```

| Piece | Where | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Acquisition | engine `TouchEventConverterEvdev`, bound to a display by patch `0122`; Ozone's `wl_touch` when nested | Upstream's touch path, unchanged |
| Page | `html.css` (patch `0186`) | `touch-action: none` on `<app>`, so a finger on a window is never the page's pan or zoom |
| `<app>` | `html_app_element.cc` | Forwards each touch pointer event as a touch point in the client's coordinates. The first finger also focuses the window, as a click does. Points end canceled when the element leaves the page or changes window |
| Wire | `domicile_protocol::touch::Touch` | `down`, `motion`, `up`, `cancel` |
| Delivery | `domicile-compositor` (`touch.rs`) | The seat always has `wl_touch`. One window's points at a time, owned by the connection that began them. A client that bound `wl_touch` gets touch points; one that did not gets the first finger as the pointer and its left button, as Weston and Mutter do. Ends canceled on window close, lock, input capture or a dropped connection |

- **Whether a client reads touch is fixed at the first finger.** A client
  that binds `wl_touch` mid-sequence is not sent an up it had no down for.
- **Smithay sends `cancel` only to points with an event since the last
  frame,** so the compositor first resends each point where it is.

### Edge swipes

One touchscreen finger in from a display's edge, which the shell binds as it
binds touchpad gestures. A tty only: nested, the host's edges are the host's.

```
evdev ──▶ EventFactoryEvdev ──▶ TouchEdgeSwipes ──▶ EdgeSwipe ──┬─▶ DeskGestures `gesture` ──▶ bindKeys
          (UI thread)           (per device:        (decides)    │   (taken: the page never has it)
                                 withholds, replays)             └─▶ DispatchTouchEventNow ──▶ page
                                                                     (withheld touches first, as they came)
```

| Piece | Where | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Hook | engine `event_factory_evdev.cc` (patch `0188`) | Hands each touch to `TouchEdgeSwipes` before dispatching it |
| Withholding | `ui/events/ozone/evdev/domicile/touch_edge_swipes.*` | Per touchscreen bound to a display: the display's rect (the device's corners through its touch transform), the withheld touches, and a 250 ms timer |
| Recognizing | `ui/events/domicile/edge_swipe.*` | A finger landing within 3% of an edge the shell grabbed is withheld; in a corner, the nearer edge the shell grabbed. 6% in, mostly away from the edge: the shell's, begin to end, in display pixels. Along the edge, back out, a tap, a second finger or 250 ms: released to the page |
| Grab | `DomicileHost.grabGesture("edge:left")` | Per side, so a finger at an edge nobody binds is never withheld |

- **The engine decides, not the compositor.** Touches reach the page before
  the compositor ever sees them, so withholding has to happen where they are
  read.
- **Edges are the display's, after its touch transform,** so a turned
  display's left is still its left.
- **A finger the shell did not take is replayed whole.** The page sees the
  same press and moves it would have, only late, so a scroll that starts at
  the edge still scrolls.
- **One gesture at a time.** `DeskGestures` follows one owner, so an edge
  swipe during a touchpad gesture cuts in on it.

Two-finger scrolling already reaches clients as finger `wl_pointer.axis` with
axis stops (patch `0174`), which is what Chrome's history swipe reads.

## Bindings

`<kind>[:<fingers>][:<direction>[+<direction>…]]`, as sway's `bindgesture`:

- `kind`: `swipe`, `pinch` or `hold`.
- `fingers`: three or more. Left out, any count of three or more.
- Directions: a swipe goes `up`, `down`, `left` or `right`; a pinch goes
  `inward` or `outward`, and `clockwise` or `counterclockwise`. A hold has
  none. Left out, any way.

An edge swipe is `edge[:<side>]`: one touchscreen finger in from `left`,
`right`, `top` or `bottom`, or from any side for `edge`. It always comes in,
so it has no direction.

A binding runs once its gesture ends without being canceled. A swipe went its
larger axis's way, and also its smaller one's when that moved at least half as
far, so `swipe:3:up+left` is a diagonal. A pinch went by its last scale and its
summed rotation. Of the bindings a gesture fits, one with a count or a side
wins over one without, then more directions over fewer.

Manganese binds `swipe:3:<way>` to `focus <way>`, pointing where focus goes,
as Meta+H/J/K/L do. Four fingers move things: `swipe:4:left` and
`swipe:4:right` are `workspace next_on_output` and `prev_on_output`, the
workspace following the fingers, as do `edge:right` and `edge:left`, and
`swipe:4:down` and `swipe:4:up` are `scratchpad bring` and `scratchpad hide`:
the scratchpad hangs from the top of the screen, so it is pulled down and
pushed back up. `pinch:4:outward`, four fingers spreading, opens the launcher,
and `pinch:4:inward` toggles the overview.

## Key decisions

- **Two fingers go to the page, three or more to the shell.** Pinch zoom and
  history swipes belong to the window; workspace and overview gestures belong
  to the shell.
- **Phases, not end-only.** Bindings match on direction once committed, and
  shell animations follow the fingers.
- **Guest pinch is Chrome's visual zoom.** The shell's own scale stays 1.
- **libinput recognizes; the engine keeps its numbers.** No thresholds of our
  own and no new settings.
- **Grabs name a kind and count, not a direction.** The engine has to take a
  gesture at its begin, before it has gone anywhere.
- **The first page to grab a gesture gets all of it,** begin to end, as
  `DeskGestures` decides at the begin.
- **A shortcut inhibitor silences gesture bindings,** as it does keys, but the
  window holding it does not get them yet: the engine takes the gesture before
  it knows. See [KNOWN-GAPS.md](/docs/KNOWN-GAPS.md).

## Plan

- [x] Touchpad pinch to native windows, on the tty and nested.
- [x] A tty VM test with a uinput touchpad (`touchpad-gestures-on-a-tty`).
- [x] Gesture bindings in `bindKeys`, sharing its modes; Manganese
  defaults.
- [x] Touchscreen: always advertise `wl_touch`; pointer fallback for clients
  without touch. Acquired through upstream's evdev touch path, which already
  reaches the page, not libinput.
- [x] A tty VM test with a uinput touchscreen (`touchscreen-on-a-tty`).
- [x] Edge swipes, recognized in the engine with withheld touches replayed
  (`EdgeSwipeTest`, `touchscreen-on-a-tty`). No touchpad hot corners.
- [x] Bind the host's swipes when nested, subject to what the host consumes.
