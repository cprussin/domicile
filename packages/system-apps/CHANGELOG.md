# @domicile-desktop/system-apps

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 506b12f: Apps known only by an id that no desktop entry uses, such as `com.chromium.Chromium`, are named by a matching entry or a readable form of the id ("Chromium") in portal dialogs, the sharing indicators, global shortcut conflicts and portal notifications.
- e612f06: `openers` also offers each supertype's applications, nearest first, from `mime/subclasses` and `text/plain` for every `text/*`. A `text/plain` default now opens Markdown and source code from the launcher.
- 2fe5852: Everything that took `system(domicile)` takes `desktop(domicile)`, or the namespace it calls.
  
  - SDK: `keyboard.keymaps` and `keyboard.selectKeymap`. `watchMenu`, `readIconTheme`, `watchIconTheme` and `previewFile` take `{ dbus }` or `{ files }`. `MenuSystem`, `IconThemeSystem` and `PreviewSystem` are `MenuDesktop`, `IconThemeDesktop` and `PreviewDesktop`.
  - system-apps: functions take `AppsDesktop` (`./apps-desktop`). `./fake-system`'s `fakeSystem` is `./fake-desktop`'s `fakeDesktop`.
  - component-library: `AppChooser`'s `system` prop is `domicile`; `PortalDialogs`' `systemOf` is `desktopOf`, and its `host` is a whole `DomicileHost`; `systemFolders` is `desktopFolders`, over `domicile.files`; `usePictureUrl` and `useApps` take `domicile.files` and `AppsDesktop`.

### Patch Changes

- ab2d2f0: The engine hands `Shell` the typed `Domicile` and an app's `main` the `AppDomicile`, built by the SDK's layer, which the engine bundles. Shells and apps no longer call `desktop()`/`appDesktop()`. The SDK drops `system()`, the portal watch helpers and `./appearance` from its public API; use the `Domicile` namespaces.
- 56e1c22: File picker polish:
  
  - New folder button, and a Hidden files toggle (Ctrl+H).
  - The listing updates when the folder changes.
  - A path box (Ctrl+L, or the pencil button). The save name box no longer walks a `/`.
  - No key help in the sidebar; full-size sidebar buttons.
  - Portal labels drop GTK's `_` access key marks ("_Save" shows as "Save").
  - `System.createDir` (`create_dir`) makes a directory. `FileRequest.list` is replaced by `FileRequest.folders` (`systemFolders` in `@domicile-desktop/component-library/folders`).
- 44d0983: Switch keyboard layouts at runtime. `input.keyboard.keymaps` lists named keymaps; the first is the one the desktop starts on. The `keymap next` and `keymap <name>` commands switch every keyboard and show a toast, and the new `Keymap` bar item, in the default bar left of the theme toggle and on the lock screen, shows and switches it. The item's list and the toast show xkb's name for each layout. A switch lasts until the desktop restarts. The shell option `keymap.hideDefault` hides the item on the first keymap, and the Settings app's Keyboard page edits the list.
  
  The component library adds `ChoiceRow` (`RadioRow`, `CheckboxRow` and `ChoiceList`), the screenshot picker's rows as a component, and `ChoiceToast` takes a `detail` line.
- 3146073: Each package asks for the bun and Node its workspace does: `engines` is `bun >=1.4.2`, `node >=24`.
- 52a1d65: The screenshot and screen share pickers draw a window that is not on screen, such as a tab behind another, in place of the desk when it is picked. `System.previewWindow` draws one, through the compositor's new `preview_window` system call.
- 2430e48: Screen recording: `domicile screen-record` and the Screen Record launcher entry pick a screen, window or region and record it with its sound to `~/Videos/Screen recordings/`, with a floating toolbar (pause, resume, stop, discard) left out of the recording.
