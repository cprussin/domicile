# @domicile-desktop/component-library

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 25b9bd3: Draw the Sound panel's device pickers as soft rows that match the panel.
  
  - `component-library`: `Select` takes `surface`: `field` (the default), `filled` (a soft row sized like a panel's `ListRow`, with an up-and-down caret) or `quiet`. `surface="quiet"` replaces the `quiet` prop. Inside a panel over the wallpaper, its list is dark in either theme, as the panel is.
  - `manganese-bar-module-volume`: the speaker, microphone, app and sound card pickers are `filled`.
  - `manganese-window-management`: site permission pickers use `surface="quiet"`.

### Minor Changes

- 77fd631: A bar button stays lit while the panel it opened is open. New `fillOverPhoto` color and `_hoverOrOpen` condition.
- 923e65b: Top bar tooltips are design-system tooltips: a frosted pill under the item that stays on its screen. `Tooltip` takes a `tone`, and `Popover` takes a `tooltip` for its trigger.
- 3980a9a: A `Cast` bar item lists the TVs nearby: extend the desktop onto one, or cast what the share picker picks to it. `@domicile-desktop/sdk/cast` runs the casts, and `<PortalDialogs />` answers a cast's own ScreenCast request. No backend finds TVs yet, so the item stays hidden.
- 9d0934e: Network details can be copied. `DetailList` values can be selected, and a `copyable` row shows a copy button on each line under the pointer. Wi-Fi and wired details offer one for each address, gateway, DNS server, interface name and hardware address. DNS servers sit one to a line.
- a9a62e8: The quick settings Dark mode switch wipes over to its new state with the rest of the screen. `useTheme` adds `painted`, the theme the page is drawn in.
- 0e8c788: Extension popups size themselves as in Chrome: Blink's auto-resize, between 25x25 and 800x600. Phantom no longer grows wider on every layout, and Solflare gets its full 402x600. The tray shows a popup once its page has loaded, so it no longer opens narrow and then jumps. `contentWidth` and `contentHeight` report only for an `extensionpopup` view. `Popover` takes `withheld`, to lay a panel out before showing it.
- d9f5353: The file dialog's sidebar lists every user folder `user-dirs.dirs` names (including Templates and Public), under its own name, each directory once and never the home again. `Folders` has `userFolders`.
- 56e1c22: File picker polish:
  
  - New folder button, and a Hidden files toggle (Ctrl+H).
  - The listing updates when the folder changes.
  - A path box (Ctrl+L, or the pencil button). The save name box no longer walks a `/`.
  - No key help in the sidebar; full-size sidebar buttons.
  - Portal labels drop GTK's `_` access key marks ("_Save" shows as "Save").
  - `System.createDir` (`create_dir`) makes a directory. `FileRequest.list` is replaced by `FileRequest.folders` (`systemFolders` in `@domicile-desktop/component-library/folders`).
- 3f7e261: Gmail's unread count is a badge on the item's end corner, like Messages and the notification bell; the item shows the inbox total. The badge is the new `CountBadge` component, which Messages and the bell now share. Messages caps its badge at "9+" and pops it in, as the bell does.
- b49fa3a: Add a Google Messages bar item: Messages for web in a panel, with a count of its new messages. Popovers can stay mounted while closed and open from triggers on other bars, and a bar item's panel can keep the keyboard.
- 7a29c8f: Icons in the bar, quick settings and level notices move when their state changes or they are pointed at: the bell swings, Wi-Fi arcs fill out, Bluetooth dots slide out, speaker waves pulse, a slash draws across what is off, the dark mode sun turns to a moon, and more. New `Animated*Icon` components and `_controlHover` / `_controlActive` conditions in the component library. The notifications bar item no longer exports a Panda preset.
- be59aae: Inboxes in the notification drawer: `runManganese({ inboxes })` lists inboxes above the notifications, and their unread conversations count toward the bell. An inbox is plain data (`Inbox.Watched` or `Inbox.Page`, from `@domicile-desktop/manganese-notifications/inbox`). New packages `@domicile-desktop/manganese-inbox-gmail` (`gmailInbox`) and `@domicile-desktop/manganese-inbox-google-messages` (`messagesInbox`, which opens in the drawer, widened, with a back button). The Gmail and Google Messages bar items stay, and export what the inboxes share. `SlideOver` gains `keepMounted`, `onBack` and `wide`.
- 44d0983: Switch keyboard layouts at runtime. `input.keyboard.keymaps` lists named keymaps; the first is the one the desktop starts on. The `keymap next` and `keymap <name>` commands switch every keyboard and show a toast, and the new `Keymap` bar item, in the default bar left of the theme toggle and on the lock screen, shows and switches it. The item's list and the toast show xkb's name for each layout. A switch lasts until the desktop restarts. The shell option `keymap.hideDefault` hides the item on the first keymap, and the Settings app's Keyboard page edits the list.
  
  The component library adds `ChoiceRow` (`RadioRow`, `CheckboxRow` and `ChoiceList`), the screenshot picker's rows as a component, and `ChoiceToast` takes a `detail` line.
- 6825067: The launcher is a quicker panel: the search box is its header (no "Open" title, no outline, a line under it), it is narrower (880px), matched letters are bold rather than teal, the picked row is a neutral highlight, and the footer is gone. Glass dialogs are near white in light mode. `Input` takes `flush`, `ModalDialog` takes `titleHidden`, and `ModalDialog`'s `lg` size is 880px.
- cd02e0e: The volume, microphone and brightness toast is larger, with a big icon, the level as a number and a thick meter. Pressing a key again while it is up updates it in place instead of showing it again. The component library adds `LevelToast`.
- 840418d: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth lists hold their height while they load or are empty. Searching shows what it looks for with rings spreading out from it, "No networks nearby" offers a "Look again" button, and the Scan button turns while it scans. `Loading` gains an `icon` and drops its `row` layout, `EmptyState` gains an `action`, and `IconButton` a `busy` prop.
- e1205bb: Add `Notice`, a pill that briefly shows a change such as a zoom level or volume, with an optional level meter.
- 670713c: The app chooser asks in plain words. With one application it asks "Open Claude?" beside Claude's icon ("Chromium wants to open this link in Claude."); with several, "Choose an app to open this link"; with none, "No app can open this link" and only Close. The link shows on one muted line at the bottom. `AppChooser` takes `asker`, `opened` and `address` in place of `title` and `description`.
- 4ee2c21: Panels over the wallpaper, such as the bar's popovers, stay dark in light mode. Everything in them, including buttons, fields and cards, now uses the dark theme's colors, so nothing is lost against the panel. Gray text is darker in light mode and lighter in dark mode, so it reads on cards. `CountBadge` takes `inline` to sit beside text.
  
  The notifications popup uses the see-through panel, like quick settings. An inbox's unread count is a pill at the end of its row, in place of the total.
- e83ec4a: Bar panels never show blank. New `EmptyState` and `Loading` panel parts: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Sound, notifications and inboxes say when they are off, empty or still checking, and Bluetooth says when it couldn't be read.
- 7a786a4: Quick settings, its Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Sound details, and the notifications panel are built from shared panel parts (`Panel`, `PanelHeader`, `PanelSection`, `ListRow`, `DetailList`, `SliderRow`, `PanelNote`, `PanelFooter`, `IconButton`) with one type scale and set of colors, so they line up and nothing spills out of its panel. Bluetooth devices are grouped as connected, paired and nearby; refusals say what failed in plain words; and a panel opened with the pointer no longer shows a focus ring on its first control.
- d80e2f5: Popups stay inside their window. `PopupBoundary` keeps every tooltip, popover, menu and list inside it within its box; `Popover` and `Tooltip` take `spansWindows` to leave it. Each window and tab keeps its popups inside its frame, so a tab's tooltip no longer covers the windows beside it. `test-support/popup-layout` fakes the layout a popup is placed by.
- c15ba93: Shells and manganese packages take the typed `Domicile` instead of the raw host. `PortalDialogs` takes `domicile` (no more `host`/`desktopOf`), `usePortalWallpaper` and manganese-host's helpers take `Domicile` slices, and the SDK's `bindKeys`, `fireGlobalShortcuts`, `watchShellOptions` and `casting` take namespaces. Adds `portals.fireShortcut`.
- 2fe5852: Everything that took `system(domicile)` takes `desktop(domicile)`, or the namespace it calls.
  
  - SDK: `keyboard.keymaps` and `keyboard.selectKeymap`. `watchMenu`, `readIconTheme`, `watchIconTheme` and `previewFile` take `{ dbus }` or `{ files }`. `MenuSystem`, `IconThemeSystem` and `PreviewSystem` are `MenuDesktop`, `IconThemeDesktop` and `PreviewDesktop`.
  - system-apps: functions take `AppsDesktop` (`./apps-desktop`). `./fake-system`'s `fakeSystem` is `./fake-desktop`'s `fakeDesktop`.
  - component-library: `AppChooser`'s `system` prop is `domicile`; `PortalDialogs`' `systemOf` is `desktopOf`, and its `host` is a whole `DomicileHost`; `systemFolders` is `desktopFolders`, over `domicile.files`; `usePictureUrl` and `useApps` take `domicile.files` and `AppsDesktop`.
- 52a1d65: The screenshot and screen share pickers draw a window that is not on screen, such as a tab behind another, in place of the desk when it is picked. `System.previewWindow` draws one, through the compositor's new `preview_window` system call.
- 3e5b976: The print dialog labels every option and saves to PDF: pick "Save to PDF" as the destination, then where to save it.
- f4a973d: Quick settings: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tiles open their panels instead of switching; Keep awake, Night light and Dark mode become a row of switches (`QuickToggle`). The network panel groups by Wired and Wi-Fi with details folded away (`ListRow` `disclosure`). Sound lists outputs and inputs by port name to pick from.
- 341debf: Quick settings: one bar item (`@domicile-desktop/manganese/QuickSettings`) replaces the theme, keep awake, brightness, volume, Bluetooth, network and battery items in `DEFAULT_BAR` and `LOCK_BAR`. Its button shows the network, sound and battery, plus the eye while the screens are kept on and Bluetooth while a device is connected. Its panel has labeled tiles (Wi-Fi or Wired, Bluetooth, Keep awake, Night light, Dark mode), the brightness and volume sliders, and the battery in words with the time left, and a Settings button. A tile's arrow opens the item's panel in place. Each hardware item exports its parts as `./quick-settings`; the component library adds `QuickTile`, and `system-battery` reads UPower's `TimeToEmpty` as `secondsLeft`.
- 599d60f: Make IPv6 addresses in the network panel easier to read.
  
  - `system-network`: `Addressing` splits `addresses` into `ipv4` and `ipv6`, and leaves out temporary IPv6 addresses.
  - `component-library`: `DetailList` takes an `address` option that wraps a value only between its colon-separated groups and grays its prefix length.
  - `manganese-bar-module-network`: the details show IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on their own rows, as addresses.
- 2430e48: Screen recording: `domicile screen-record` and the Screen Record launcher entry pick a screen, window or region and record it with its sound to `~/Videos/Screen recordings/`, with a floating toolbar (pause, resume, stop, discard) left out of the recording.
- 9fd298a: The screen share picker offers browser windows, streaming the page alone, and previews each source on the desk. The screenshot picker shows the same preview tiles.
- c4fe915: The screenshot picker lists what to save beside one preview of the desk, which outlines the pick with its size. It fits on the screen, arrow keys move through the list, and a Copy button copies the pick.
- 1e2aeca: Select an area on the real screen from the screenshot, screen share, recording and cast pickers ("Select on screen"). The area stays with corners to resize it, can be dragged to move it, and has its own Back, Cancel and Share or Save buttons.
- 21b82af: The share picker picks a region by dragging over its desk preview, as the screenshot picker does.
- 427c184: The screen share picker is laid out as the screenshot picker is: screens and windows in a list beside the desk, which outlines each pick. The screenshot picker offers browser windows that are not on screen, such as a tab behind another.
- 5a6a4fc: Simplify the sound mixer:
  
  - Speakers and microphone each get a picker over their volume.
  - Only the microphone is metered, inside its slider's track.
  - Each app has one volume; its page moves it to another device.
  - Sound card modes move to their own page, with plain names.
  - `DrilldownPage` opens a page one level deeper than a `Drilldown`'s view. A `Drilldown`'s `detail` is optional.
- 0bd0d2a: The desktop draws its text in Inter, which ships with it, instead of the computer's default sans-serif face. The manganese `font` option picks another installed face.
- 570e7bb: Tabs, title bars and the browser's address bar share one look. Titles are 13px with 16px icons. The open tab, the focused title bar and the browser toolbar are one surface (white in light mode) on a darker tab strip, which resting title bars match. A tab shows its float and maximize buttons only under the pointer, and a hidden tab its close button, so titles get the room. The address field is a 13px, tinted, edgeless field until clicked; the padlock is gray; zoom controls show only while a page is zoomed. `Autocomplete` takes `filled`.
- 63728a9: Window and browser icons move too. Tabs and title bars: Close snips, New tab reaches out, Float's windows lift apart and gather into Tile's squares, Maximize's corners push out and travel into Restore's, and a group's new layout builds in. Browser toolbar: Back and Forward dart, Reload winds and spins into Stop, zoom's minus and plus draw in and reach out, the lock snaps shut on a secure page, site settings' knobs slide, and each new download drops into its tray. New `AnimatedCloseIcon`, `AnimatedPlusIcon`, `AnimatedMinusIcon`, `AnimatedFloatIcon`, `AnimatedMaximizeIcon`, `AnimatedLayoutIcon`, `AnimatedCaretIcon`, `AnimatedReloadIcon`, `AnimatedLockIcon`, `AnimatedSlidersIcon` and `AnimatedDownloadIcon`, and a `direction` for icon parts.

### Patch Changes

- bafd922: Settings and History show their icon in title bars and the screenshot and screen recording pickers. The pickers also show each browser window's site icon.
- a62f35a: Bar item text (battery, keyboard layout, Gmail, mode, tray letters) is 13px, like the clock. New `fontSizes.ui` token (13px), the desktop's one text size.
- 44eb13c: A screenshot, color pick or screen cast opens over a portal dialog already up, such as the app chooser, so it can capture that dialog.
- c7a232d: Center a panel footer's line between its rule and the panel's edge.
- fa78a81: Darken panels over the wallpaper in dark mode too, so their text reads over a bright website.
- 509f948: Darken panels over the wallpaper in light mode, so their text reads over a white wallpaper.
- a2ee8ea: Access dialogs: Allow is drawn in the accent, the body is one muted line, and who asks sits opposite the buttons. Dialog corners are rounder.
- ab2d2f0: The engine hands `Shell` the typed `Domicile` and an app's `main` the `AppDomicile`, built by the SDK's layer, which the engine bundles. Shells and apps no longer call `desktop()`/`appDesktop()`. The SDK drops `system()`, the portal watch helpers and `./appearance` from its public API; use the `Domicile` namespaces.
- a1569c6: File dialog rows are easier to read: names are 16px, as in the launcher, and the kind column and sidebar 14px.
- 6fecbbd: The file dialog's fields are a soft fill, edged only on hover or focus.
- 258d9aa: The file dialog is calmer: folders have a plain teal icon and files a gray one with no tile behind them, the picked row and the current place use a neutral highlight, column headers are 11px, sidebar and list text are 13px, and the list is white in light mode.
- 14e6071: An application's file chooser, and the print dialog's save picker, are modal like every other dialog: drawn over every window, with the rest of the desktop inert. A window's open tab and floating windows covered them.
- 506b12f: Apps known only by an id that no desktop entry uses, such as `com.chromium.Chromium`, are named by a matching entry or a readable form of the id ("Chromium") in portal dialogs, the sharing indicators, global shortcut conflicts and portal notifications.
- 00e5da2: Disabled ghost and outline buttons fade further, so they read as disabled next to enabled ones (e.g. the browser's Back and Forward).
- 75b9403: Ghost and other buttons in Settings, History and the site lose the outline they drew when not focused. The preset now sets the page's color scheme, light or dark, so packages no longer replace its `html` rules. A switch in Settings says "Off" when it is off.
- 6730912: A browser window hidden behind a tab can be screenshotted, previewed and shared: the engine lists it as `isCaptured` while a capture runs, and manganese keeps it laid out under the shown tab. The screenshot and share pickers keep their size when a pick shows a preview. A shared screen's cursor reaches consumers that read it as metadata, such as Chrome.
- 2a87739: The screenshot and screen cast pickers take a part of a window that is not on screen, dragged over its preview.
- 4967b5d: Email inbox rows show the conversation total under the name and the unread count in the pill, which counts to 99+ in line with text.
- 8bc5b85: Elements draw an outline only while it can show: on keyboard focus, and always on controls so their focus ring still fades. A transparent outline on every element made Chromium repaint anything that moved, every frame.
- 3146073: Each package asks for the bun and Node its workspace does: `engines` is `bun >=1.4.2`, `node >=24`.
- 4759ab2: The share and screenshot pickers call the whole desk "Everything".
- 0f4582e: - The share picker offers the whole desk and picks it at first, as the screenshot picker does.
  - A hidden window's preview keeps the share and screenshot pickers' size.
  - A picked item keeps its fill under the pointer: a selected tab, the current tab rail tab or file picker place, a picked file or picker row.
- d138939: Center the quick settings button's icons. The Wi-Fi icon dims its unlit arcs instead of hiding them, so it keeps its shape at any signal. The battery in the button drops its own inset and the room it kept for `100%` (new `fitted` prop, `BatteryIndicator` export), so both ends of the button match.
- 4064278: Quick settings is tidier. The panel is narrower and evenly padded. A tile's status line is easier to read on the accent color. The brightness and volume sliders start and end together, and their percentages are larger. The battery line and Settings button are smaller and quieter. The mixer's captions match the slider figures.
- b39d80e: A screen cast that may share a monitor may share a region of one too, so a browser's share picker lets you drag an area.
- ee63a45: The top bar's sharing indicator says what is shared. It is a red "Sharing screen" pill, and its panel lists each source by name with what of it is shared: a window with its application, a screen by make and model, all screens, or part of a screen with its size. A region covering one whole screen is listed as that screen, and one covering every screen as all of them, instead of "Region". `Captured` carries a window's app id, a monitor's description, the monitor a region is on, and a new `Desk` kind.
- 113dabe: The boot splash crossfades into manganese's themed background instead of white.
- 2edc3c1: `Tabs`: a tab row too wide for its space scrolls sideways instead of widening the page.
- b241f68: A desktop that boots in a different theme from the one its shell remembered no longer stays stuck half faded in and ignoring the pointer. The compositor answers a theme capture with nothing to turn, and a wipe's hold can no longer freeze another view transition.
- 6c3db42: A virtual monitor can be resized in place with `resize`, keeping its output, windows and casts.
