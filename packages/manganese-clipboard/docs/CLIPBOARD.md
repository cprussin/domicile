# The clipboard

**Meta+Shift+V** opens the clipboard history: what is on your clipboard, then
what was copied before, newest first. Choosing a row makes it the current
selection. Source: `src/`.

- It steers like the launcher, on the same `ResultList` rows: a search box
  keeps focus, typing narrows the rows to those holding every word, and the
  keyboard and pointer move one highlight.
- The current copy is in its own group above the rows, not a row, since
  choosing it would change nothing. Searching hides it and narrows only the
  rows. The highlight starts on the copy before it.

## Why

A Wayland selection lives in the client that copied it. Closing that client
empties the clipboard. When you pick a row, the compositor serves the paste,
so the copy outlives the client that copied it.

## How it works

- The compositor reads each new selection over a pipe and keeps the last 32,
  up to 128 MiB in all. A repeat moves to the top. See
  `domicile_host::clipboard`, tested in `packages/domicile-host/tests/clipboard.rs`.
- The compositor pushes the history to the page, so the panel is current when
  it opens.
- A row is an id and a preview of up to 480 characters. The full copy stays in
  the compositor; `copyClipboardEntry` takes the id. This limits how much of a
  copied secret reaches the page.
- Text and images. A copy keeps its text and one image (PNG if offered, else
  the first `image/` type). An image-only row reads `Image, 1920 × 1080`, or
  `Image (image/webp)` when it is not a PNG. Its `image` is true, and a PNG's
  row carries a `thumbnail` (a PNG `data:` URL at most 256 pixels a side), which
  the panel shows beside the row's text. Every image row has an image glyph.
- The panel shows up to four lines of each copy, keeping its line breaks.
  Selections with neither (file drags) are skipped.
- Memory only. Nothing is written to disk.
- The clipboard only. The primary selection (highlighted text) stays out of
  the history, so every highlight does not bury what was copied.
- An empty history shows a message.

## Clipboard managers

- The compositor serves `ext-data-control-v1` and `zwlr_data_control_v1`, so
  clipboard managers, `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` work with no window focused.
  Sandboxed clients are not offered them
  ([PORTALS.md](/docs/PORTALS.md#sandboxed-clients)).
- Both selections. A data-control copy enters the history like any other, and
  a restored row is what data-control clients read.
- Tested in `packages/domicile-compositor/tests/selection.rs` and
  `packages/e2e-harness/tests/e2e-data-control.sh`.

## Browser windows

- On a tty, the engine uses the compositor's clipboard
  (`ui/ozone/platform/drm/domicile/drm_clipboard.h` in the fork), so browser
  windows and clients share one clipboard, text and images.
- In a nested run, the browser uses the host session's clipboard instead.
  [KNOWN-GAPS.md](/docs/KNOWN-GAPS.md#clipboard) tracks this gap.
