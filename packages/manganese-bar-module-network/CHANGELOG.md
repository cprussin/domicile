# @domicile-desktop/manganese-bar-module-network

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 558794b: The network item stays on the bar after a lock and when the network service fails, hiding only on a machine with no network hardware. It shows a cable that iwd or wpa_supplicant cannot report, and its panel lists each wired port with its speed, addresses and gateway. `system-network` adds `interfaces`: the hardware from `/sys/class/net` and addresses from `ip`, which the compositor's wrapper now puts on `PATH`.
- 341debf: Quick settings: one bar item (`@domicile-desktop/manganese/QuickSettings`) replaces the theme, keep awake, brightness, volume, Bluetooth, network and battery items in `DEFAULT_BAR` and `LOCK_BAR`. Its button shows the network, sound and battery, plus the eye while the screens are kept on and Bluetooth while a device is connected. Its panel has labeled tiles (Wi-Fi or Wired, Bluetooth, Keep awake, Night light, Dark mode), the brightness and volume sliders, and the battery in words with the time left, and a Settings button. A tile's arrow opens the item's panel in place. Each hardware item exports its parts as `./quick-settings`; the component library adds `QuickTile`, and `system-battery` reads UPower's `TimeToEmpty` as `secondsLeft`.
- 599d60f: Make IPv6 addresses in the network panel easier to read.
  
  - `system-network`: `Addressing` splits `addresses` into `ipv4` and `ipv6`, and leaves out temporary IPv6 addresses.
  - `component-library`: `DetailList` takes an `address` option that wraps a value only between its colon-separated groups and grays its prefix length.
  - `manganese-bar-module-network`: the details show IPv4 and IPv6 addresses on their own rows, as addresses.

### Patch Changes

- 77fd631: A bar button stays lit while the panel it opened is open. New `fillOverPhoto` color and `_hoverOrOpen` condition.
- 1caba05: Dimmed top bar items (muted, off, offline) keep the full hover background; only the icon dims.
- 923e65b: Top bar tooltips are design-system tooltips: a frosted pill under the item that stays on its screen. `Tooltip` takes a `tone`, and `Popover` takes a `tooltip` for its trigger.
- 9d0934e: Network details can be copied. `DetailList` values can be selected, and a `copyable` row shows a copy button on each line under the pointer. Wi-Fi and wired details offer one for each address, gateway, DNS server, interface name and hardware address. DNS servers sit one to a line.
- 7a29c8f: Icons in the bar, quick settings and level notices move when their state changes or they are pointed at: the bell swings, Wi-Fi arcs fill out, Bluetooth dots slide out, speaker waves pulse, a slash draws across what is off, the dark mode sun turns to a moon, and more. New `Animated*Icon` components and `_controlHover` / `_controlActive` conditions in the component library. The notifications bar item no longer exports a Panda preset.
- 840418d: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth lists hold their height while they load or are empty. Searching shows what it looks for with rings spreading out from it, "No networks nearby" offers a "Look again" button, and the Scan button turns while it scans. `Loading` gains an `icon` and drops its `row` layout, `EmptyState` gains an `action`, and `IconButton` a `busy` prop.
- 59b63cd: The network panel shows the Wi-Fi connection's addresses and gateway with every backend, lists each address on its own line at a fixed width so IPv6 addresses don't widen it, and leaves out deprecated IPv6 addresses.
- 3146073: Each package asks for the bun and Node its workspace does: `engines` is `bun >=1.4.2`, `node >=24`.
- e83ec4a: Bar panels never show blank. New `EmptyState` and `Loading` panel parts: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Sound, notifications and inboxes say when they are off, empty or still checking, and Bluetooth says when it couldn't be read.
- 7a786a4: Quick settings, its Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Sound details, and the notifications panel are built from shared panel parts (`Panel`, `PanelHeader`, `PanelSection`, `ListRow`, `DetailList`, `SliderRow`, `PanelNote`, `PanelFooter`, `IconButton`) with one type scale and set of colors, so they line up and nothing spills out of its panel. Bluetooth devices are grouped as connected, paired and nearby; refusals say what failed in plain words; and a panel opened with the pointer no longer shows a focus ring on its first control.
- c15ba93: Shells and manganese packages take the typed `Domicile` instead of the raw host. `PortalDialogs` takes `domicile` (no more `host`/`desktopOf`), `usePortalWallpaper` and manganese-host's helpers take `Domicile` slices, and the SDK's `bindKeys`, `fireGlobalShortcuts`, `watchShellOptions` and `casting` take namespaces. Adds `portals.fireShortcut`.
- 1f1775a: The `system-*` libraries take `desktop(domicile)` instead of `system(domicile)`, and call its `files`, `processes` and `dbus` namespaces. Their host types are renamed to match: `NetworkSystem` is `NetworkDesktop`, `WifiSystem` is `WifiDesktop`, `InterfaceSystem` is `InterfaceDesktop`, `AudioSystem` is `AudioDesktop` and `SysfsSystem` is `SysfsDesktop`.
- f4a973d: Quick settings: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth tiles open their panels instead of switching; Keep awake, Night light and Dark mode become a row of switches (`QuickToggle`). The network panel groups by Wired and Wi-Fi with details folded away (`ListRow` `disclosure`). Sound lists outputs and inputs by port name to pick from.
- 1971d87: React hooks for system state. Each `system-*` package has a `/react` with hooks and one watch per desktop: `useBattery`, `useBluetooth`, `useNetwork`, `useWifi`, `useAudio` and more. `@domicile-desktop/react` gains the shared watches (`sharedWatch`, `perDesktop`, `useSharedWatch`, `useDeskWatch`, `watchPresence`). manganese-host's `domicile-context`, `per-host`, `shared-watch`, `useSharedWatch` and `watch-presence` move there, and manganese uses `<DomicileProvider>`.
- 44f23d6: The top bar is easier to read: the clock is larger, workspaces are numbers with the current one on a lit square instead of a white disc, and bar buttons light up as rounded squares like the rest of the desktop.
- 42f1cd0: The Wi-Fi section no longer shifts when Wi-Fi turns on or off: its Scan button is now as tall as the switch beside it.
- 1d6f437: The network panel keeps the keyboard while open, so a Wi-Fi password typed into it no longer goes to the focused window.
