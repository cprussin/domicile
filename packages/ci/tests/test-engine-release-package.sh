# runs.
#
# The checked build runs DCHECKs and the official one does not. The tarball is
# the only thing an integrator has, so it has to say which one it holds. The
# flavor comes from the build's own `args.gn`, and packaging stops when that
# is missing, unrecognized, or disagrees with `DOMICILE_ENGINE_BUILD`, which
# picks the release tag.
#
# What ships: `locales/*.pak` without the build's `*.pak.info`, and every ELF
# without its symbol table. The build directory keeps both, for the
# measurements in docs/architecture/ENGINE-FORK-MEASUREMENTS.md.
#
# The build directory is faked with empty files and one small ELF, `zstd` with
# `cat`, and Chromium's `llvm-objcopy` with binutils' `objcopy`.
