# @domicile-desktop/sdk

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 3980a9a: A `Cast` bar item lists the TVs nearby: extend the desktop onto one, or cast what the share picker picks to it. `@domicile-desktop/sdk/cast` runs the casts, and `<PortalDialogs />` answers a cast's own ScreenCast request. No backend finds TVs yet, so the item stays hidden.
- 40f5af3: The engine casts the desktop to Google Cast TVs: `domicile.googleCast` lists them, and casts to them and stops. `engineCast(domicile.googleCast)` in `@domicile-desktop/sdk/cast` is its backend, and the `Cast` bar item uses it, so it shows when a TV is near.
- ab2d2f0: The engine hands `Shell` the typed `Domicile` and an app's `main` the `AppDomicile`, built by the SDK's layer, which the engine bundles. Shells and apps no longer call `desktop()`/`appDesktop()`. The SDK drops `system()`, the portal watch helpers and `./appearance` from its public API; use the `Domicile` namespaces.
- 56e1c22: File picker polish:
  
  - New folder button, and a Hidden files toggle (Ctrl+H).
  - The listing updates when the folder changes.
  - A path box (Ctrl+L, or the pencil button). The save name box no longer walks a `/`.
  - No key help in the sidebar; full-size sidebar buttons.
  - Portal labels drop GTK's `_` access key marks ("_Save" shows as "Save").
  - `System.createDir` (`create_dir`) makes a directory. `FileRequest.list` is replaced by `FileRequest.folders` (`systemFolders` in `@domicile-desktop/component-library/folders`).
- e42226f: `theme.force_dark` names sites, such as `mail.google.com`, that the browser draws dark with Chromium's automatic dark mode while the theme is dark, for sites with no dark theme of their own.
- 35b8470: The Google Messages item counts unread conversations read from the page, including ones that were unread before the desktop started, rather than counting its notifications. `<webview>` gains `countMatches(selector)`, which counts the elements in its page that match a CSS selector.
- 6730912: A browser window hidden behind a tab can be screenshotted, previewed and shared: the engine lists it as `isCaptured` while a capture runs, and manganese keeps it laid out under the shown tab. The screenshot and share pickers keep their size when a pick shows a preview. A shared screen's cursor reaches consumers that read it as metadata, such as Chrome.
- 44d0983: Switch keyboard layouts at runtime. `input.keyboard.keymaps` lists named keymaps; the first is the one the desktop starts on. The `keymap next` and `keymap <name>` commands switch every keyboard and show a toast, and the new `Keymap` bar item, in the default bar left of the theme toggle and on the lock screen, shows and switches it. The item's list and the toast show xkb's name for each layout. A switch lasts until the desktop restarts. The shell option `keymap.hideDefault` hides the item on the first keymap, and the Settings app's Keyboard page edits the list.
  
  The component library adds `ChoiceRow` (`RadioRow`, `CheckboxRow` and `ChoiceList`), the screenshot picker's rows as a component, and `ChoiceToast` takes a `detail` line.
- 57b5b1f: A watch's and a D-Bus match's `items` are `Listened<T>`: `Listened.Heard(item)`, or `Listened.Missed()` after a compositor restart, when changes in between were not heard. The battery, Bluetooth, network, tray menu and icon theme readers read again then.
- b2c6fd5: Cast the desktop to Miracast TVs (Fire TV, Roku, Samsung, LG, Windows wireless displays) over Wi-Fi Direct or the LAN. The new `domicile-miracast` service runs each cast; `miracastCast(domicile)` in `@domicile-desktop/sdk/miracast` is its backend, and the `Cast` bar item lists its TVs.
- 93f015d: A page can ask for window management, local fonts, idle detection and automatic downloads. The shell asks the user, and Settings and the site panel show each.
- b85d9bb: Name what keeps the screens on. A new `idle_holds` system call (`session.idleHolds()` in the SDK) lists the windows and applications holding idle inhibitors, and the bar's eye opens and names them. The compositor logs each change, and the input that restarts the idle clock when it was getting close to blanking or locking, naming the event and device for the browser's own input.
- fccc784: Automatic brightness and a night light, as on macOS. The backlight follows the room's light from iio-sensor-proxy and learns from the levels the user sets. The night light warms every monitor from sunset to sunrise in the time zone's city, or on custom hours, with a switch in the brightness popover. Both are on by default and set in the Settings app's Shell page or under `shell_options`. Shells set the color temperature with `domicile.displays.setColorTemperature(kelvin)`.
- bbf849b: A client can ask to be laid out at a named place in the shell's page (`domicile_anchor_v1`). Shells read it as `DomicileWindow.anchor`.
- 3bb9bd5: A download's file picker starts in the download folder (`XDG_DOWNLOAD_DIR`). The file chooser event has `currentFolder`.
- c15ba93: Shells and manganese packages take the typed `Domicile` instead of the raw host. `PortalDialogs` takes `domicile` (no more `host`/`desktopOf`), `usePortalWallpaper` and manganese-host's helpers take `Domicile` slices, and the SDK's `bindKeys`, `fireGlobalShortcuts`, `watchShellOptions` and `casting` take namespaces. Adds `portals.fireShortcut`.
- 2fe5852: Everything that took `system(domicile)` takes `desktop(domicile)`, or the namespace it calls.
  
  - SDK: `keyboard.keymaps` and `keyboard.selectKeymap`. `watchMenu`, `readIconTheme`, `watchIconTheme` and `previewFile` take `{ dbus }` or `{ files }`. `MenuSystem`, `IconThemeSystem` and `PreviewSystem` are `MenuDesktop`, `IconThemeDesktop` and `PreviewDesktop`.
  - system-apps: functions take `AppsDesktop` (`./apps-desktop`). `./fake-system`'s `fakeSystem` is `./fake-desktop`'s `fakeDesktop`.
  - component-library: `AppChooser`'s `system` prop is `domicile`; `PortalDialogs`' `systemOf` is `desktopOf`, and its `host` is a whole `DomicileHost`; `systemFolders` is `desktopFolders`, over `domicile.files`; `usePictureUrl` and `useApps` take `domicile.files` and `AppsDesktop`.
- 52a1d65: The screenshot and screen share pickers draw a window that is not on screen, such as a tab behind another, in place of the desk when it is picked. `System.previewWindow` draws one, through the compositor's new `preview_window` system call.
- 3e5b976: The print dialog labels every option and saves to PDF: pick "Save to PDF" as the destination, then where to save it.
- 2430e48: Screen recording: `domicile screen-record` and the Screen Record launcher entry pick a screen, window or region and record it with its sound to `~/Videos/Screen recordings/`, with a floating toolbar (pause, resume, stop, discard) left out of the recording.
- 9fd298a: The screen share picker offers browser windows, streaming the page alone, and previews each source on the desk. The screenshot picker shows the same preview tiles.
- 20a1fc5: `desktop(domicile)` (`@domicile-desktop/sdk/desktop/desktop`) builds the desktop as one typed object, a namespace per subject: `windows`, `browser`, `displays`, `keyboard`, `pointer`, `theme`, `appearance`, `session`, `clipboard`, `tray`, `notifications`, `extensions`, `portals`, `files`, `processes`, `dbus`, `capture` and `shell`. Values are `undefined` rather than `null`, and each namespace's events come through `on`, which returns its unsubscribe. `appDesktop(host)` does the same for an app module.
- ee63a45: The top bar's sharing indicator says what is shared. It is a red "Sharing screen" pill, and its panel lists each source by name with what of it is shared: a window with its application, a screen by make and model, all screens, or part of a screen with its size. A region covering one whole screen is listed as that screen, and one covering every screen as all of them, instead of "Region". `Captured` carries a window's app id, a monitor's description, the monitor a region is on, and a new `Desk` kind.
- ca86667: A shell can add a monitor with no connector, which the desk extends onto and only a capture shows, with `system(domicile).addVirtualMonitor()`. Casting to a TV extends the desk this way.
- ee1cc17: `<webview partition="persist:name">` gives a page storage of its own, kept on disk; any other name keeps it in memory. `openBrowserWindow(url, partition)` opens a window in one, listed with its `partition`. A page's own navigation fires a cancelable `domicile-will-navigate` first.

### Patch Changes

- a88ce23: The engine is a workspace package: its shell tests run in `test:shell`, and its checks against a built tree in `test:engine`.
- 2a87739: The screenshot and screen cast pickers take a part of a window that is not on screen, dragged over its preview.
- 3146073: Each package asks for the bun and Node its workspace does: `engines` is `bun >=1.4.2`, `node >=24`.
- 75799a0: Dragging a window's edge no longer makes its contents jitter. While an `<app>` or `<webview>` has `resizing`, the window's latest frame shows at its own size in the top left corner until the window draws at the new size, instead of being stretched to the new size and then snapping back.
- b1041f8: The last package-specific scripts leave `scripts/`: `dev-shell` becomes a package the shells' `start:dev` runs, docs media capture moves into the site, `update-engine-release.sh` and the IDL check into the engine, and `smoke-compositor.sh` into the e2e harness.
- eb6b52a: Dragging a browser window's edge no longer holds the whole desktop to the page's pace. While a `<webview>` has the `resizing` attribute, as an `<app>` already could, the page's latest frame stretches to each new box at once instead of the desktop waiting for the page to draw at it. Manganese sets it on every browser window during a resize.
