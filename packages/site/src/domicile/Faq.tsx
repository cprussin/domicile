    answer:
      "The goal is for Domicile to feel no slower than any other Wayland compositor, not to be the fastest or lightest one. Running Chromium has a natural overhead, but in most ways it's the same overhead as running Chromium inside another compositor.",
    link: {
      href: repoFile("docs/architecture/ENGINE-FORK-MEASUREMENTS.md"),
      label: "See the measurements",
    },
    question: "Is it faster than my current desktop?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "No. An Electron app bundles its own Chromium and runs as an ordinary Wayland app, as it would on any desktop.",
    link: { href: "/docs/manganese/compatibility", label: "What it runs on" },
    question: "Do Electron apps share the desktop's Chromium?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "Yes, with extensive help from Claude, which wrote most of the code, tests and docs. The architecture, direction and technical decisions come from the project's human maintainer. Changes are checked by the test suite and by daily use, not by line-by-line human review. The source and its full history are public.",
    link: { href: REPO, label: "Source" },
    question: "Was Domicile built with AI?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "No. Only your shell and app modules get `domicile`. A page in a browser window is an ordinary website.",
    link: { href: "/docs/shells/system-access", label: "System access" },
    question: "Can websites use the desktop APIs?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "Anything you can. It runs as you, with your files, programs and D-Bus. Install shells and apps you trust, as you would any program.",
    link: { href: "/docs/apps/build", label: "Build an app" },
    question: "What can a shell or an app do?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "No. A shell can be Rust, or any language that compiles to WebAssembly. The Dioxus example is the quickstart shell in Rust, with a 3-line JavaScript file that loads it.",
    link: { href: "/docs/shells/writing#in-rust", label: "Shells in Rust" },
    question: "Do I have to write my shell in JavaScript?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "A reload or `domicile load-shell` keeps every window running and starts only the shell's page over. If the engine crashes, it restarts: your apps keep running with their state, but browser windows close. If the compositor crashes, browser windows stay, but apps lose their connection. Most exit, and the ones your shell launched start again fresh, without unsaved work.",

        "docs/architecture/THE-DOMICILE-BINARY.md#crashes-are-recovered",

    },
    question: "What happens if the desktop crashes or reloads?",
  },
  {
    answer: `The engine is Chromium ${CHROMIUM.version} (\`main\` at \`${CHROMIUM.revision.slice(0, 10)}\`) with Domicile's patches. Moving to a newer Chromium is a pull request that CI builds and tests, and it reaches you with the next Domicile release, through your package manager or a flake update. There is no fixed schedule, and no promise on how fast a Chromium security fix ships.`,

    question: "Which Chromium is it, and how does it get updates?",
  },
  {
    answer:
      "Wayland apps do, and Electron, SDL and Qt apps start in Wayland mode. There is no Xwayland, so X11-only apps don't run.",
