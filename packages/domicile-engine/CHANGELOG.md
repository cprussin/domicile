# @domicile-desktop/engine

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 63db244: Chrome never draws a dialog over the desktop. Any Chrome dialog the shell has no answer for is canceled and logged, so a gap fails closed. Payment Request and FedCM ("Sign in with Google"'s account chooser) are off, so sites use their own checkout and sign-in pages, and picture-in-picture video is off since Chrome floats it in a window of its own. Document picture-in-picture still opens, as a shell window.
- a354497: A site or proxy that asks for a username and password now asks in the shell, over the page, instead of in Chrome's unstyled dialog drawn over the desktop. `<webview>` fires `domicile-sign-in`.
- 1af639c: File access, client certificate, Bluetooth pairing and extension permission prompts now ask in the shell, over the page, instead of in Chrome's unstyled dialogs drawn over the desktop. Sites in browser windows can now be allowed to edit files they open. `<webview>` fires `domicile-prompt`.
- 18413ff: A link for an app, such as Zoom or Slack, asks "Open Zoom?" over its page in the shell's style, naming the app and showing its icon, instead of Chrome's unstyled "Open xdg-open?" dialog. A secure site can be let open these links without asking. Shells get `domicile-external-app` on `<webview>`.
- 69fe0d8: A page that can't load, has a certificate problem, is flagged as unsafe or crashes now shows a shell page with Try again, Go back or Continue anyway, instead of Chrome's own error and warning pages. `<webview>` reports why as `pageFailure` with `domicile-page-failure-change`, and `proceedPastWarning()` passes a warning.
- 9246b97: A page's color, date and time pickers and a text box's suggestion list are now drawn by the shell, hung from the control, instead of by Chrome. `<webview>` fires `domicile-picker` with the control's kind, value, suggestions and box, answered with `choose()` or `cancel()`.
- bb1e4cb: A page's tooltips, the "send the form again?" question on reload and the "page isn't responding" question are now the shell's, instead of Chrome's. `<webview>` reports its tooltip as `tooltip` with `domicile-tooltip-change`, and `domicile-prompt` gains the `resend-form` and `unresponsive` kinds. Reloading a page a form posted to used to do nothing; it now asks.

### Patch Changes

- d69b2f4: A page's notification names its browser window, so only the Gmail inbox's own window has its duplicate notifications cleared; Gmail in another window notifies again.
- e8696d9: `domicile load-shell` goes back to the shell you had when the new one fails to run, and prints why.
- 4b5b6f7: On a tty, a website's own pointer image (such as the hand over a Google map) turns with a rotated monitor instead of showing on its side.
- f14ec1c: A tty desktop whose graphics card cannot draw, even on the CPU, no longer restarts its GPU process forever on a black screen. Chromium's GPU crash limit is back on, and when no GPU mode works `domicile` stops with "renderer unavailable" and exit code 69.
- 7e3f354: Shells can use WebAssembly, so a shell can be written in Rust or another language that compiles to wasm. `examples/dioxus-shell` is one, in Dioxus.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 0eedcd6: On a tty, Mesa can open the card inside the GPU sandbox, and VMware cards are off Chromium's GPU blocklist, so a VMware guest with 3D on composites on the GPU instead of the CPU.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fdad979: Middle-clicking Back or Forward in a browser window's address bar opens that step in a new window, as Chrome does in a new tab. The new window keeps the page's history, and the window you clicked in stays where it was.
  
  `<webview>` gains `goBackInNewWindow()` and `goForwardInNewWindow()`.

### Patch Changes

- 8d8417d: App windows show when the engine's GPU process falls back to software, as in some VMs: the compositor sends them in memory instead of leaving them transparent.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fe90bca: App windows can belong to an app id, and a launch can reuse that app's open window instead of opening another: `domicile open --app --id <id> --reuse focus|navigate <url>`, or `browser.openApp(url, { id, reuse })`. Windows list their `appId`. `browser.countMatches(id, selector)` counts elements in a browser window's page, hidden or not.
- 66d220b: Show a browser window's zoom and finished downloads in popups that hang from the address bar, as Chrome does. The downloads popup lists each file with Open, Show in folder and Remove from list, and the Downloaded indicator opens it again. `<webview>` gains `downloadCompletedPaths` and `removeCompletedDownload()`; `Popover` gains `anchor` and `quiet`; `ListRow` gains `endOnHover`.
- d3a65c5: Clipboard history rows say whether a copy is an image: `DomicileClipboardEntry.image` is true for an image with no text, and manganese's clipboard history draws those rows with an image glyph.
- eca2588: Clipboard history rows show a thumbnail of a copied image: `DomicileClipboardEntry.thumbnail` is a small PNG `data:` URL (empty for none; the SDK gives `undefined`), and `RowTile` takes a `picture` to draw in place of its glyph.
- 9fe15f8: Downloads from every window, browser and app alike, now show in one Downloads item on the bar, shown while there are any. It says how far the downloads in progress have come, and its panel lists each download with where it came from, to cancel, open, show in its folder, or remove. The address bar's downloads chip and the downloads popup over the page are gone.
  
  The engine keeps one list of the desk's downloads, so a download outlives its window. The SDK reads it as `domicile.downloads` (`list`, `cancel`, `remove`, `clear`, and a `change` event); `<webview>`'s per-page download properties, `clearCompletedDownloads`, `removeCompletedDownload` and `downloadschange` are removed.
- f3156a1: Emulated input (remote desktop, input sharing) on a desktop on a TTY now reaches the shell and the lock screen, as on a headless desktop. A headless desktop's monitors draw at their own scale, and emulated pointers land where they point on a scaled or rotated monitor.
- 40f5af3: The engine casts the desktop to Google Cast TVs: `domicile.googleCast` lists them, and casts to them and stops. `engineCast(domicile.googleCast)` in `@domicile-desktop/sdk/cast` is its backend, and the `Cast` bar item uses it, so it shows when a TV is near.
- ab2d2f0: The engine hands `Shell` the typed `Domicile` and an app's `main` the `AppDomicile`, built by the SDK's layer, which the engine bundles. Shells and apps no longer call `desktop()`/`appDesktop()`. The SDK drops `system()`, the portal watch helpers and `./appearance` from its public API; use the `Domicile` namespaces.
- 5955f66: On a headless desktop, input from a remote desktop app (EIS) reaches the shell and its lock screen, so the desktop can be driven and unlocked with no keyboard or mouse attached. Screen casts of a headless desktop now show the pointer.
- 401b0b4: `OZONE=headless` runs a full desktop with no display device or seat, such as on WSL2. Its monitors are virtual ones the shell adds, and screen casts show each one. Apps draw in shared memory, GL apps included.
- fccc784: Automatic brightness and a night light, as on macOS. The backlight follows the room's light from iio-sensor-proxy and learns from the levels the user sets. The night light warms every monitor from sunset to sunrise in the time zone's city, or on custom hours, with a switch in the brightness popover. Both are on by default and set in the Settings app's Shell page or under `shell_options`. Shells set the color temperature with `domicile.displays.setColorTemperature(kelvin)`.
- ca86667: A shell can add a monitor with no connector, which the desk extends onto and only a capture shows, with `system(domicile).addVirtualMonitor()`. Casting to a TV extends the desk this way.

### Patch Changes

- 494a3f0: Reading pixels back from a page's canvas no longer waits for the screen to refresh on a tty, so pages that read many canvases no longer freeze.
- c7af3d5: Each Google Cast asks the shell what to show, so Extend and Cast… work after an earlier cast; before, the engine silently recast its first pick. A cast to a TV of another shape is letterboxed in black, not green.
- b8bdff3: Casting or recording a rotated monitor shows the pointer upright, as it looks on the monitor, instead of turned with the panel.
- 06cf6dd: The homepage FAQ names the Chromium version and revision the engine is built on, read from the engine's pin, and says how a newer Chromium reaches you. `CHROMIUM_VERSION` holds the pin's version, and a check keeps the two in step.
- f23af29: Show the shell's pointer shapes (grab hand, resize arrows, link hand) on every monitor, not only the one hosting the desk page.
- da62acc: `distro/` and `distro-checks` merge into `packages/distro`. Files every distribution installs (session, launchers, portal, systemd targets, D-Bus service) move from `nix/` to `share/`; `nix/` keeps only the Nix modules.
- 17064a7: A browser window whose `<webview>` moves in the shell's document shows its page again where it lands. Before, the page stayed detached and the window froze, which happened when a window crossed monitors while being resized.
- a88ce23: The engine is a workspace package: its shell tests run in `test:shell`, and its checks against a built tree in `test:engine`.
- ecd3fba: An extension's `action.openPopup()` opens its popup in the tray, so Phantom's tray button opens Phantom. The SDK reports the request as `extensions.on("popup")`.
- 0e8c788: Extension popups size themselves as in Chrome: Blink's auto-resize, between 25x25 and 800x600. Phantom no longer grows wider on every layout, and Solflare gets its full 402x600. The tray shows a popup once its page has loaded, so it no longer opens narrow and then jumps. `contentWidth` and `contentHeight` report only for an `extensionpopup` view. `Popover` takes `withheld`, to lay a panel out before showing it.
- 62a671f: An extension's `sidePanel.open()` opens its side panel as a tiled window of its own, with no address bar, so Phantom, which opens in its side panel by default from 26.37, opens again. A popup an extension asks for opens under the icon that was clicked, on that monitor, not on the focused one; the tray state gains `clicked`.
- 7b48b3b: A page in a browser window is told the monitor it is on as its `screen`, not the box around every monitor. A fullscreen video that sizes itself to the screen is letterboxed instead of cropped.
- 901b871: The keystroke latency run divides by the display frame viz reports, not an assumed 60 Hz, and also reports `commit to present` from viz's presentation feedback. Its guard allows `commit to pixel` the probe's floor plus one frame, so a 120 Hz panel passes.
- b85d9bb: Name what keeps the screens on. A new `idle_holds` system call (`session.idleHolds()` in the SDK) lists the windows and applications holding idle inhibitors, and the bar's eye opens and names them. The compositor logs each change, and the input that restarts the idle clock when it was getting close to blanking or locking, naming the event and device for the browser's own input.
- 1931e3e: The night light warms an AMD laptop's screen as soon as it turns on, not only after the screen next blanks.
- 86d2d09: A native window growing under the pointer no longer flashes white at its new edges.
- b1041f8: The last package-specific scripts leave `scripts/`: `dev-shell` becomes a package the shells' `start:dev` runs, docs media capture moves into the site, `update-engine-release.sh` and the IDL check into the engine, and `smoke-compositor.sh` into the e2e harness.
- 8e980fa: Sites are told the browser is Google Chrome, in `navigator.userAgentData` and `Sec-CH-UA`. Akamai's bot check refused Chromium's brands on some sign-ins, such as Citi's.
- c55d65e: A native tooltip (an `<img title>`) on a desk with several monitors opens beside the pointer, on that monitor.
- fe9f571: A browser window's page no longer reads `hidden` for a moment when its window is shown or attached, so pages that refetch or animate on `visibilitychange` stay still.
