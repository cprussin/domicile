# Headless and software-composited like the other <webview> guards. A
# stand-in compositor (guard-app-module-compositor.py) answers the control
# socket. The guard sends `run_app` to the engine's command socket, naming
# guard-app-module-app/app.js. Then it asserts:
#
#   the engine answered `opened`   the command reached the engine
#   main ran once                  the app's document was served and DomicileApp
#                                  called its `main`
#   the host is narrow             `main` was handed a DomicileAppHost, which
#                                  has no `spawn`, not the shell's DomicileHost
#   the compositor heard app_hello the app's channel said it is an app
#   the answer reached the app     the call crossed both ways
#   the app fetched its own file   fetch() reads the app's origin (patch 0126)
#   and not the shell's            ShellURLLoaderFactory::MayReadFiles refuses
#                                  another origin
#
# Control: NEGATIVE=1 also opens the app's address with `open_url`, in a
# window no app was opened in. That window must not run the app: an app's
# address follows from its path, so only the pin keeps any page from opening
# any directory as an app. `main` must still have run once.
