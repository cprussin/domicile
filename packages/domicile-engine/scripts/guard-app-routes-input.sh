# An `<app>` sends its client what lands on it, in the client's own surface
# coordinates, with nothing on the page routing it.
#
#   nix develop .#full --command \
#     ./packages/domicile-engine/scripts/guard-app-routes-input.sh /build/chromium/src
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Input over an `<app>` used to be routed by page script: the
# SDK's `registerElements` measured the element's box and transform in script,
# inverted them, and called `pointerMotion`, `pointerButton`, `key` and the
# rest itself. The engine does it now -- the element maps through its own
# layout box and every transform above it, and the desktop forwards -- so a
# shell calls nothing. This page calls nothing and has no pointer listener of
# its own. See packages/chrome-sdk/docs/ELEMENTS.md.
#
# WHAT IT ASSERTS. The stand-in records every line the engine writes, and the
# pointer, wheel, key and focus lines must be exactly, in order:
#
#   pointer_motion  term 100,50     the move: `term` is turned and scaled, so
#                                    only the whole transform inverted lands
#                                    450,150 on the client's 100,50
#   focus_app       term            the press asks, and nothing cancels
#   pointer_motion  term 100,50
#   pointer_button  term 272 down   BTN_LEFT
#   pointer_button  term 272 up
#   pointer_axis    term 0,100 / 0,120  a 100px wheel is one detent
#   key             term 30 down    the keyboard follows the press
#   key             term 30 up
#   pointer_leave   term            the pointer went off every window
#   focus_app       term            a press on `menu` asks for its window
#   pointer_motion  menu 20,20
#   pointer_button  menu 272 down
#   pointer_button  menu 272 up
#
# and the page heard `domicile-focus-requested`, cancelable and bubbling, for
# `term` twice.
#
# HOW IT CAN FAIL. NEGATIVE=1 draws the same two boxes as `<div>`s and drives
# the same input. The page hears the press -- it says so -- and not one of the
# lines above may reach the compositor: a run where they do is a run where they
# did not come from the element under test. A key's release with no window is
# allowed through: a release is sent for every key the page hears, because the
# compositor's seat may hold the press.
