# A video a page puts in picture-in-picture is listed to the shell, which shows
# it and whose controls reach the page (patch 0211,
# domicile_picture_in_picture.cc).
#
#   nix develop .#full --command \
#     ./packages/domicile-engine/scripts/guard-webview-video-picture-in-picture.sh /build/chromium/src
#
# Headless and software-composited: nothing is measured in pixels, so this
# does not say the shell's element draws the video, only that the shell is
# handed it.
#
# Chrome floats a picture-in-picture video in a window of its own. The engine
# lists it instead (`DomicileHost.pictureInPictureVideos`), and the shell draws
# it in an `<app picture-in-picture>` and acts on it with
# `actOnPictureInPictureVideo`.
#
# The shell module opens guard-webview-video-picture-in-picture-server.py's
# /video in a browser window. Once the video plays, the guard asks for
# picture-in-picture with a user gesture over the debugging port. The shell
# shows each listed video and then closes it.
#
# Assertions, in order; each is meaningful only if the previous one holds:
#
#   the shell ran                    or nothing was set up
#   the shell drew the window        its page has somewhere to play
#   the video played                 a video with frames, which the request
#                                     needs (the control)
#   the page entered                 the request was granted
#   the shell heard it               listed, for the window it drew
#   the shell's close reached it     the page left, paused
#   the listing went                 the shell's list emptied
