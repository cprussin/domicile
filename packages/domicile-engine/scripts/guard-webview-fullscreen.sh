#
# Headless with software compositing, like guard-webview-click.sh: nothing here
# is measured in pixels.
#
# A page's `requestFullscreen()` reaches its WebContentsDelegate's
# `EnterFullscreenModeForTab`, which content's default ignores, so the page
# waits forever. `WebViewGuest` enters, tells the renderer through the widget's
# visual properties, and tells the element as `PageFullscreenChanged`, which
# fires `domicile-page-fullscreen-change`. Escape in the page and the element's
# `exitPageFullscreen()` both leave through `WebContents::ExitFullscreen`. A
# unit test cannot check this: happy-dom has no nested browsing context.
#
# The page is guard-webview-fullscreen-server.py's: a plain top half and a
# fullscreen button in the bottom half.
#
# Assertions, in order; each is meaningful only if the previous one holds:
#
#   the shell page ran               or nothing was set up
#   a press reached the shell's      the harness can deliver a press; without
#     document                        it, an absence below means nothing
#   there is a page in the window    a guest was made, attached and navigated
#   a press reached the page         the hit test crossed into the guest
#   the request was not refused      content let the page ask
#   the shell heard fullscreen       the element's `pageFullscreen` turned true
#   the page entered fullscreen      the page's own `fullscreenchange`, so the
#                                     renderer saw the grant
#   Escape left fullscreen           the element and the page both left
#   the button entered again         a second request works after the first
#   exitPageFullscreen() left it     the shell's way out
#
# NEGATIVE=1 is the control: the press lands on the plain half, which asks for
# nothing. Nothing may be reported, or the positive run's report could come
# from the press or the load rather than the request.
