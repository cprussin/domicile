# Guard: a download in a browser window asks the shell where to save, and the
# file lands there.
#
#   nix develop .#full --command \
#     ./packages/domicile-engine/scripts/guard-webview-download.sh /build/chromium/src
#
# Runs headless; nothing here is measured in pixels.
#
# Patch 0053 routes a guest's download to WebViewGuest::ChooseDownloadPath,
# which asks the element in save mode like an `<input type="file">`, instead of
# Chrome's portal save dialog. It also sets `download.prompt_for_download` so
# every download asks.
#
# Assertions, in order:
#
#   the shell page ran
#   a press on the strip reached the shell's document (the harness works)
#   the guest page loaded
#   the press landed on the guest's link
#   the file was fetched
#   the browser called ChooseDownloadPath
#   the shell was asked in save mode with the site's file name
#   the shell answered without throwing
#   the file is at the shell's path with the site's bytes (the claim)
#
# NEGATIVE=1 runs a shell that cancels. Nothing may be saved anywhere in the
# home, proving the browser does not save regardless of the answer.
#
# The guard uses its own empty home, so any file there with the site's bytes
# is this run's download.
