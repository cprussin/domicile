# Checks an app window with an id is reused instead of opened again: by

# Headless and software-composited: nothing is measured in pixels.
#
# DeskWindows::OpenApp matches an open app window by its id. "focus" brings it
# to the front through WebViewGuest::RequestFocus, which fires
# `domicile-focus-request` on its <webview>; "navigate" also loads the
# address in it (docs/architecture/WEB-APPS.md).
#
# The guard opens `mail?n=1` with app id `mail`, then `mail?n=2` with "focus",
# then `mail?n=3` with "navigate", each once the last one's window is drawn.
# The shell opens `chat` with app id `chat` twice in a row, with "focus", and
# counts the chat page's three `p.item`s.
#
# Asserts, in order (each only meaningful if the previous holds):
#
#   the shell ran                       it can list windows
#   the engine answered each `opened`   the commands reached the engine
#   a mail window is listed             the shell can draw it
#   it was drawn                        a focus request has an element to reach
#   the third address is loaded in it   "navigate" loads it in the open window
#   only one mail window was listed     "focus" and "navigate" open none
#   the mail window asked to be in front, twice
#                                       the shell would raise it
#   a chat window is listed             the shell's openAppWindow opened one
#   only one was                        the shell's second call reused it
#   the count is 3                      countBrowserWindowMatches counts in it
#
# NEGATIVE=1 opens every window with "new". There must then be three mail
# windows, two chat windows and no focus request, so a run where nothing is
# ever opened twice cannot pass.
