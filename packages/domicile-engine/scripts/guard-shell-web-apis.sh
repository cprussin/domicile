# Patch 0068 allows notifications for the profile, and patch 0066 classes the
# shell as loopback.
#
# Headless and software-composited, like guard-webview-notifications.sh, which
# tests where notifications go.
#
# Asserts that the shell paints its box, which it does only when notifications
# are granted and a fetch of `/cors` on another origin succeeds.
#
# NEGATIVE=1 runs two legs:
#
#   1. the box painted without checking must show, proving the harness sees it
#   2. a fetch of `/no-cors` must not show, proving CORS is enforced
