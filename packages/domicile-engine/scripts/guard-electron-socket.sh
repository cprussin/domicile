# Headless and software-composited like the other <webview> guards. The page
# is served over http by python's http.server. The shell
# is guard-app-module.js, which draws every browser window, and the
# compositor stand-in is guard-app-module-compositor.py. A python client plays
# `electron-host` and asserts:
#
#   ready              the socket was bound and took the hello
#   window_opened      the window opened as an app window of the app
#   window_loaded      its page finished loading
#   title_changed      its page's title reached the app
#   window_closed      destroy_window closed it, and the app heard
#   chrome:// refused  the control: a page the app may not open stays shut
