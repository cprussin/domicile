# Runs headless with software compositing: nothing here is measured in pixels.
#
# A browser window's `view.focus()` moves DOM focus out of the shell document,
# so the shell sees no keys and the compositor sees none to match. The guest's
# WebContentsDelegate matches claimed chords in the browser process instead.
# A unit test cannot check this: jsdom has no nested browsing context, so focus
# never leaves the shell there.
#
# Checks, in order, since each depends on the one before:
#
#   the shell claimed a chord
#   there is a page in the window       a guest was made, attached and navigated
#   the element has the keyboard        or keys go to the shell
#   nothing was relayed                 `grab_shortcut` never reaches the
#                                        control socket: the browser process
#                                        holds the claims
#   the chord reached the shell         the main claim
#   the modifiers reached the shell     needed for Alt-dragging a float
#   an ungrabbed key reached the guest  seen as a modifier change only the
#     and not the shell's document      guest's hook reports
#   an unclaimed chord came back        Ctrl+R returns to the shell as
#     and a plain key did not           `domicile-guest-keydown`
#   the requested zoom arrives          the shell answers Ctrl+R with
#                                        setZoom(1.5); the element reports it
#                                        and the page's width changes
#
# One key is pressed before the window takes the keyboard, and the shell
# document must report it. Without that, "the shell did not see the second key"
# could mean no page receives key events. If the first key is missing too, the
# guard says so; the chord checks are browser-side and still count.
#
# NEGATIVE=1 is the control: an <iframe> in place of the <webview>, with the
# same keys. It takes the keyboard but has no guest delegate, so no chord may
# fire. This separates the delegate's matching from a harness that drives no
# key at all.
#
# The control's <iframe> stays empty: it does not load the http page on a
# domicile:// document. The control only decides whether the chord fires, so
# this does not matter. `$HTTP_LOG` shows whether the page was requested.
