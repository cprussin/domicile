#
# `domicile-test-client --scrolling-bubble` scrolls a #339966 stripe down its
# window, a step each frame, and moves a sync subsurface bubble (#C04020) onto
# the stripe in the same commit. The shell (guard-scrolling-bubble.js) calls
# `syncFrames()` and sets each `<app frame>` in the same render as the move.
# The compositor casts its monitor to PipeWire (`DOMICILE_CAST_MONITOR`), and
# `domicile-test-cast-reader` prints where both colors are in each frame. The
# claim: in every frame that shows the bubble, its top is the stripe's.
#
# Control: NEGATIVE=1 runs the same synced shell, but it places each window
# where the move before put it (`?late=1`): the move without its frame. The
# bubble must be off its stripe in at least one frame, so the claim's frames
# can show a lag. A page that ignores frames is no control: it embeds the
# frames the control channel names with each move, so it does not lag either.
#
