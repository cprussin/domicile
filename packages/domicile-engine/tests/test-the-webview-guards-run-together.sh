# Tests that `run-checks.sh` runs the headless webview guards concurrently.
# They share no broker, profile or log, and take free ports
# (`test-the-webview-guards-take-free-ports.sh`). Other checks stay serial, and
# the run still stops at the first failure.
#
# No more than `DOMICILE_ENGINE_CHECKS_AT_ONCE` run at once: every one starts a
# browser, and all of them at once starve each other on `crux`.
#
# When the job sets `CARD_OWNER`, every check but latency runs as noise, so
# another run's latency guard waits for it. Latency runs as none, or it would
# wait for its own run.
