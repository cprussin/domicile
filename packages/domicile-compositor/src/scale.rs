//! Converts between a display's pixel ratio and Wayland's scales.
//!
//! The chrome lays out in CSS pixels, the display has some device pixels per
//! CSS pixel, and Wayland uses logical units with an integer buffer scale.
//! The conversions live here, outside the commit path, so they can be tested.

/// The `wl_output` scale to advertise for a chrome reporting `ratio` device
/// pixels per CSS pixel, capped at `max`.
///
/// `wl_output.scale` is an integer, so a fractional ratio rounds up: a client
/// drawing extra pixels is downscaled and stays sharp, while one drawing too
/// few is stretched and blurry. Exact fractional scaling needs
/// `wp_fractional_scale_v1`.
///
/// `max` exists because scale N renders N² times the pixels, which may be
/// more than the machine can draw.
