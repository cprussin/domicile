//! The shell's own screen recording, as `SystemRequest::ScreenRecord`
//! describes.
//!
//! The shell picks one source in the screen cast picker, as itself. Its
//! stream, with the pointer drawn in, goes to `domicile-recorder`, which
//! encodes it and the stream's sound into a WebM in the videos folder. The
//! recording is listed as a [`CapturingKind::Recording`] until the shell
//! stops or discards it, its source goes, or the recorder fails. The shell
//! pauses and resumes it meanwhile.
//!
