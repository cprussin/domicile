//! The thread that builds the launcher's file index and keeps it current.
//!
//! The logic lives in [`domicile_host::file_index`],
//! [`domicile_host::home_walk`] and [`domicile_host::file_changes`]. This
//! module runs them and decides when to republish the index and how long to

//!
//! [`FileIndex`] stays on this thread. Connections answering `search_files`

//! Walking a home directory blocks on disk for seconds, so it runs on its own
//! thread instead of the Wayland event loop.
