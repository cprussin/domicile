//! `domicile-compositor`: the Wayland server for Domicile.
//!
//! The web engine renders the desktop, so this binary does no drawing of its
//! own. It serves the Wayland globals clients need, manages their surfaces and
//! buffers, and drives [`domicile_host::Host`]: a mapped toplevel calls
//! [`Host::app_appeared`] and a closed one calls [`Host::app_closed`].
//!
//! Client buffers reach the engine as viz surfaces (see `engine_session`).
//! `wl_shm` frames are first copied into a GPU buffer, or into memory for an
//! engine on the CPU (see `uploads`). Design:
//! `docs/architecture/WINDOW-COMPOSITING.md`.
