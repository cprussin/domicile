//! The queue from the Wayland thread to the chrome writer.
//!
//! The Wayland thread must never wait on a chrome. It also injects input,
//! answers frame callbacks and flushes clients, so a stall on a socket freezes
//! input for every client, long enough for a held key to start repeating.
//!
//! The queue is unbounded. It carries only lifecycle messages and clients'
//! window requests, which cannot be dropped. They are small and arrive at the
//! rate windows open, close and change state.
