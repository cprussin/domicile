//! What a real Wayland client is told the screens are.
//!
//! `desktop.rs` covers what the chrome is told. A compositor can describe two
//! displays to the chrome while advertising one `wl_output`, or update the
//! chrome on reload while leaving open windows on the old displays. These
//! checks catch that.
//!
//! A window enters every display until the page reports its bounds
//! (`set_app_bounds`), then the displays it overlaps. The reload check also
//! reads `wl_surface.leave`, so it can tell a compositor that updates a
//! window's displays from one that never does.
//!
//! The client's own trace reports the outputs, so no `wayland-info` is
//! needed.
