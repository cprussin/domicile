# @domicile-desktop/e2e-harness

## 0.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 4432cb1: Adds `check-runner`, which runs a package's shell checks under turbo's `test:shell`; the skip scan moves to it from `e2e-harness`.
- e455955: `domicile open <file|folder|url>` opens anything: a web link in a browser window, anything else with its type's default from `mimeapps.list`, supertypes counted (a `text/plain` default opens Markdown and source code). `domicile open --app <url|module>` opens a site or app module as an app. Domicile's `xdg-open` and the launcher's Enter run it, so apps, terminals and the launcher agree. `open-url`, `open-app` and `run-app` are gone: use `open` and `open --app`.
- 0f04f3c: The end-to-end checks move from `scripts/` into the package's `tests/` and run in its `test:e2e`.
- a88ce23: The engine is a workspace package: its shell tests run in `test:shell`, and its checks against a built tree in `test:engine`.
- 56e1c22: File picker polish:
  
  - New folder button, and a Hidden files toggle (Ctrl+H).
  - The listing updates when the folder changes.
  - A path box (Ctrl+L, or the pencil button). The save name box no longer walks a `/`.
  - No key help in the sidebar; full-size sidebar buttons.
  - Portal labels drop GTK's `_` access key marks ("_Save" shows as "Save").
  - `System.createDir` (`create_dir`) makes a directory. `FileRequest.list` is replaced by `FileRequest.folders` (`systemFolders` in `@domicile-desktop/component-library/folders`).
- e42226f: `theme.force_dark` names sites, such as `mail.google.com`, that the browser draws dark with Chromium's automatic dark mode while the theme is dark, for sites with no dark theme of their own.
- 44d0983: Switch keyboard layouts at runtime. `input.keyboard.keymaps` lists named keymaps; the first is the one the desktop starts on. The `keymap next` and `keymap <name>` commands switch every keyboard and show a toast, and the new `Keymap` bar item, in the default bar left of the theme toggle and on the lock screen, shows and switches it. The item's list and the toast show xkb's name for each layout. A switch lasts until the desktop restarts. The shell option `keymap.hideDefault` hides the item on the first keymap, and the Settings app's Keyboard page edits the list.
  
  The component library adds `ChoiceRow` (`RadioRow`, `CheckboxRow` and `ChoiceList`), the screenshot picker's rows as a component, and `ChoiceToast` takes a `detail` line.
- cd52ce3: The launcher's "Open with…" now lists first the app Enter opens the file with, so the two always agree. `domicile open --which <file|url>` prints the app `domicile open` would run, and the desktop puts its own `domicile` first on its apps' `PATH`.
- 3146073: Each package asks for the bun and Node its workspace does: `engines` is `bun >=1.4.2`, `node >=24`.
- b1041f8: The last package-specific scripts leave `scripts/`: `dev-shell` becomes a package the shells' `start:dev` runs, docs media capture moves into the site, `update-engine-release.sh` and the IDL check into the engine, and `smoke-compositor.sh` into the e2e harness.
- ca86667: A shell can add a monitor with no connector, which the desk extends onto and only a capture shows, with `system(domicile).addVirtualMonitor()`. Casting to a TV extends the desk this way.
