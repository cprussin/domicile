 * - The refresh token gets an access token, kept until it expires or Gmail
 *   refuses it.
 * - Each read names the newest message of each of the {@link LATEST} newest
 *   unread conversations. A message's headers are asked for once.
 * - Each read passes `onMail` the unread messages that arrived since the
 *   last, newest first, and those no longer unread, and waits for it. The

 *   news.
