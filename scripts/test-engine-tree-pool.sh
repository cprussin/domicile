# Asserts which tree in the pool a run builds in.
#
# Switching the Chromium checkout between pins costs a reset, a `gclient sync`,
# an apply and a near-full compile, about four hours. The pool keeps N trees
# behind one path, so a pin built before is a symlink swap.
#
# Wrong answers differ in cost:
#
#   - Picking a tree without this pin when one has it costs one full build.
#   - Claiming a tree carries this pin when it does not lets
#     `engine-series-stamp.sh` skip the build and report green over uncompiled
#     code.
#
# So this script never vouches for a tree's contents. It picks a directory and
# points the path at it; the stamp check then inspects that tree.
