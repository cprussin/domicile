# Tests the verdict of `guard-webview-keyboard.sh`: which readings pass and
# which component a failure blames.
#
# The checks are ordered: with no chord claimed, or the browser window never
# focused, nothing else means anything. Easy to get backward:
#
#   - In the negative run, the chord firing is the failure.
#   - The shell's document seeing an ungrabbed key fails, because it
#     contradicts the comment in `WebViewGuest::PreHandleKeyboardEvent`.
#   - The shell's document seeing no key before focus moved still passes and
#     reports the missing reading. The claims are measured in the browser
#     process; a browser with no display to activate may deliver no DOM
#     events at all.
#
# Runs the verdict block from the real guard, so moving it fails here.
