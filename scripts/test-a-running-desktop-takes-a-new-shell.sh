# Checks a running desktop loads a new shell, opens URLs and apps, takes
# screenshots and sends the shell commands on command, via `domicile
# load-shell`, `BROWSER`, `domicile open-app`, `domicile-settings`,
# `domicile-history`, the `xdg-open` shim on its apps' PATH, `domicile
# screenshot` with and without a file, and `domicile send-shell`.
#
#   ./scripts/test-a-running-desktop-takes-a-new-shell.sh
#
# Unit tests cover the parts: `tests/cli.rs` the arguments, `tests/command.rs`
# the line sent, `tests/command_socket.rs` and `tests/compositor_socket.rs` the
# reply. This covers the wiring: the supervisor gives the engine a command
# socket, a command from another terminal reaches it, or the compositor's chrome
# socket for a screenshot or a shell command, over DOMICILE_SOCK, and a refusal
# is printed in that terminal.
#
# The engine and the compositor are small Python stubs of their sockets. The
# real sides, `components/domicile/browser/command_protocol.cc` and the
# compositor's `screenshot` and `send_shell` system calls, have their own unit
# tests.
