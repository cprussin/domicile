#   - A release for this series is already published (a re-run, or a
#     force-push or rebase that kept the series): regenerate the file and push
#     it. No build.
#   - Nothing is published: build, publish, regenerate, push.

# Both errors are costly: a needless build takes four hours, and skipping a
# needed one ships an engine the repository does not describe (#411).
