# logind treats a suspend differently from a VT switch. Only VT paths pause
# devices or drop DRM master, so across a suspend the evdev descriptors stay
# open, master is kept, and the session stays `Active`.
#
# The GPU resumes with its CRTCs reset, but the connectors report the same
# panels and modes. `ModesetWouldChangeAnything` then sees no change and the
# panels stay dark. On resume the driver must forget what the hardware
# confirmed before the sleep.

# `true` going down, `false` on return. It sends `false` even after a failed
# sleep.
#
# Needs no Chromium tree: it reads `src/` and `patches/`, so it runs in the
# shell group on every push.
