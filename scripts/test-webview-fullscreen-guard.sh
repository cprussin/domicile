# Tests the verdict of `guard-webview-fullscreen.sh`: which readings pass and
# which component a failure blames.
#
# The checks are ordered: a page that never went fullscreen only means
# something once a press reached it. Key cases:
#
#   - The shell hearing fullscreen while the page's own document never entered
#     it fails: the renderer waits on the browser's visual properties.
#   - Escape that does not leave fails: a page could keep the user in.
#   - `exitPageFullscreen()` that does not leave fails: a shell could not take
#     the page out with its window.
#   - In the control, any fullscreen report fails: the press was on the part of
#     the page that asks for nothing.
#
# Runs the verdict block from the real guard, so moving it fails here.
