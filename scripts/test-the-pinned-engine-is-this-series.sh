# Checks that the engine this checkout pins was built from the series this
# checkout carries.
#
# `packages/domicile-engine/` holds the fork: a Chromium revision, a patch
# series and the files it copies in. `engine-release.nix` names one published
# tarball and records the series it was built from. A fork change without a
# release ships a different engine than the repository describes.
# `pinned-engine.yml` catches only mismatches that break the C ABI (#411).
#
# Both sides are local, so this is a string comparison that runs in seconds
# without a Chromium tree.
#
# On a pull request that changes the fork, a mismatch is expected until
# `engine.yml` publishes the engine and writes `engine-release.nix` back to the
# branch. `e2e.yml` sets `DOMICILE_PR_HEAD_SHA` and `DOMICILE_PR_BASE_SHA`, and
# a mismatch is a skip only when both hold:
#
#   - the pin is still the base's, so the write-back will move it; and
#   - `engine.yml` has an unfinished run for that head.
#
# Everything else fails: main, a pin no write-back explains, and an engine run
# that finished or never started. The write-back push triggers the e2e run
# that passes. Without these variables (`engine-release-needed.sh`,
# `engine-proof.sh`), the check is strict.
