# Asserts when `engine-series-stamp.sh` reports that the shared checkout
# already carries the series.
#
# `engine.yml` resets /build/chromium/src to the pin and applies `patches/`
# before each build. When the series has not changed, that rewrites every
# patched file and forces a long rebuild. The checkout records the series it
# carries, and a matching run skips the reset, apply and compile.
# `engine-sync.sh` does the same for DEPS.
#
# A false positive builds something other than the pull request and reports it
# green, so every way the tree can differ must answer `false`:
#
# - the patch series changed (a patch edited, added or removed);
# - a file under `src/` changed, or is missing from the checkout;
# - `CHROMIUM_PIN` moved;
# - HEAD moved (a manual build, or another workflow reset the tree);
# - the checkout has a tracked modification, or an untracked file that is not
#   the series'.
#
# A wrong `false` only costs a full build.
